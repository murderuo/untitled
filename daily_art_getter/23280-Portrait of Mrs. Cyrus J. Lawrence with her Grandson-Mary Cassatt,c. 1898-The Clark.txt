Mary Stevenson Cassatt was an American painter and printmaker. She was born in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania (now part of Pittsburgh's North Side), but lived much of her adult life in France, where she first befriended Edgar Degas and later exhibited among the Impressionists. Cassatt often created images of the social and private lives of women, with particular emphasis on the intimate bonds between mothers and children.
Emily Lawrence is shown interrupting her knitting to grasp her grandson’s hand as he leans over the back of her chair. The portrait was commissioned by Emily’s husband, the collector Cyrus L. Lawrence, while Cassatt was visiting her family and friends in the United States after nearly twenty years abroad.
The naturalness and informality of the sitters’ poses suggest their mutual affection, demonstrating the artist’s skill in capturing both a likeness and a mood.
We present today's pastel thanks to The Clark :)
P.S. See here the incredible Mary Cassatt’s feminist mural which has gone lost!
