Wow, it's already August! Time flies!
The Landscapes and Beauties series by the 19th-century Japanese artist, Utagawa Kuniyoshi, combines women who feel eagerness for something with framed pictures of landscapes related to regional specialties. This print depicts a woman with a book, wanting to read the next. The framed scene features whitebait fishing at Nishinomiya of Settsu (present-day Hyogo prefecture), which originates from the book Sankai meisan zue (Book of Specialties from the Land and Sea), illustrated by Shitomi Kangetsu.
Love it!  : )
