Florine Stettheimer (1871-1944) was an eccentric American modernist. Unlike most other artists, Stettheimer wasn’t interested in success or fame. In fact, she often refused to show or sell her work. Because her family was financially well off, she didn’t need to sell paintings to make money. That’s why she didn’t develop much of a reputation as a painter until long after her death. The Cathedrals of Fifth Avenue is a gently-satirical view of New York City, Stettheimer’s hometown. It includes many elements characteristic of Stettheimer’s works, such as a colorful palette, unnaturally slender figures, and a stage-like composition. (Stettheimer was a big fan of the theatre, and she also designed sets and costumes.) She painted in many styles, but her works are always unusual and memorable.The painting is a mash-up of typical occurrences on one of New York City’s most famous streets. It includes names and symbols of popular Fifth Avenue establishments, like Tiffany’s, surrounding a wedding taking place inside a stage-like arch. At the bottom right, Stettheimer included herself and her sisters getting out of a taxi. Stettheimer also made three other Cathedrals paintings: The Cathedrals of Broadway, The Cathedrals of Wall Street, and The Cathedrals of Art. Painted over a period of 13 years, the series played on 1930s New York’s biggest and most over-the-top attractions.- Alexandra Kiely
