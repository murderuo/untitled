Reynolds was particularly skilled at choosing poses and actions that suggested a sitter's character and that also created a strong composition. Here, three sisters, the daughters of the 2nd Earl Waldegrave, are shown collaboratively working on a piece of needlework. The joint activity links the girls together. On the left, the eldest, Lady Charlotte, holds a skein of silk that the middle sister, Lady Elizabeth, winds onto a card. On the right, the youngest, Lady Anna, works a tambour frame, using a hook to make lace on a taut net.
We present this work thanks to the National Galleries of Scotland. : )
P.S. These four cute Joshua Reynolds’ children will make you miss childhood!
P.P.S. Dear users, we are looking for volunteers who could help us with translating DailyArt to Arabic, Japanese and Hindi. If you're interested, here are more details! :)
