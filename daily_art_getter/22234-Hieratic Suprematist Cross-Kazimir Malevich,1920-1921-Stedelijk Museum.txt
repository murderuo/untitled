Kazimir Severinovich Malevich was a Russian painter and art theoretician. He was a pioneer of geometric abstract art and the originator of the avant-garde Suprematist movement. He was a devout Christian mystic who believed the central task of an artist was that of rendering spiritual feeling.
Following after the movements of Cubism and Futurism, Kazimir Malevich worked heavily in the Suprematist movement. He placed focus on form and the purity of shapes, particularly the square, seeing it as being “free from analogical references.”
Not only was this merely about making shapes, but Malevich (along with other artists of his day) was striving to make abstract art that could “inspire a transcendental state akin to the sublime feeling that nature could inspire"—spiritual art. These artists hoped that viewers would experience a spiritual revelation or deeply meditative feeling when they looked at the artwork.
