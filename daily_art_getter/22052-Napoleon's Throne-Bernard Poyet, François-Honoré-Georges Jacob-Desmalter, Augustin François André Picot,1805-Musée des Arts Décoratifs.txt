A powerful emperor like Napoleon knows it is wise to use art to show his greatness. This is why everything defining his rule was splendorous and luxurious—including his thrones. However, this one is a little different than the others. It was designed by Bernard Poyet unlike most of Napoleon’s furniture that was usually designed by Percier and Fontaine. Poyet was said to be inspired by models these two artists created, although his project seems heavier and more spectacular. Jacob-Desmalter and the Emperor’s embroiderer Augustin François André Picot—two of the most successful chairmakers of the time—helped to realise Poyet’s vision. The throne is made of gilded wood, upholstered in red velour, and decorated in embroidered silver. The armrests are in the form of winged chimeras with the head of a lion. Napoleon was supposed to occupy this throne during sessions of the Corps Législatif. The piece looks quite different today, as it was modified several times after Napoleon’s failure—for example all of his emblems were removed. Nonetheless, the throne still epitomizes what Empire style really is.- Ania Jeznach
