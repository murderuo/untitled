Albrecht Dürer was the greatest German artist of the Renaissance. The sketch we see today is remarkable because it was based on actual encounters with people of African descent in Central Europe, rather than being the product of Dürer’s imagination. It reflects the artist’s great interest in the new people and goods moving through Europe as a consequence of growing international commerce. The woman was a 20-year old servant of the Portuguese factor João Brandão, who housed Dürer when the artist visited Antwerp in 1521. Although we know nothing more, we can guess that Brandão acquired her through his trade dealings (he was in charge of the Portuguese spice monopoly in Antwerp) and, given her name, that she had converted to Christianity.
