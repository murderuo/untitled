St. Sebastian is a painting, once part of a triptych by the Italian Renaissance artist Antonello da Messina, completed in 1477–1479. It is a major work by Antonello, and an excellent example of Early Renaissance art. What is shown is not the suffering, but rather the transfigured martyr, who is convinced of his heavenly reward. The artist has skillfully used the subject to demonstrate his ability to paint the beauty of a nude human body.
Saint Sebastian (c.  256–288 AD) was an early Christian saint and martyr. According to traditional belief, he was killed during the Roman emperor Diocletian's persecution of Christians, initially being tied to a post or tree and shot with arrows, though this did not kill him. He was, according to tradition, rescued and healed by Saint Irene of Rome, which became a popular subject in 17th-century painting. In all versions of the story, shortly after his recovery he went to Diocletian to warn him about his sins, and as a result was clubbed to death. He is venerated in the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church.
We present today's painting thanks to Staastliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden. Have a great (much calmer than Sebastian's life) Saturday!
