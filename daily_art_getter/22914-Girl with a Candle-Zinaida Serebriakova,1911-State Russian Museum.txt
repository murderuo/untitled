Zinaida Serebriakova is an artist loved by many. She managed to bring to perfection her individual talent, without losing touch with traditions and absorbing the best of the artistic concepts of the new time. Born into the famous artistic family Benois-Lanceray, Serebriakova had a great love and respect for classical art since childhood and treated innovative experiments with caution. Consciously choosing a neoclassical direction, Zinaida was educated in private studios in St. Petersburg and Paris. The fate of Serebryakova was not easy: the death of her husband, emigration, separation from her children (two of whom remained in Moscow)â€”all these influenced the work of the master, but from the very first pictures to the end of the creative path her art is dominated by a bright, lyrical beginning, admiration for beauty, and love for the world. 
We present today's paintings thanks to the State Russian Museum.
