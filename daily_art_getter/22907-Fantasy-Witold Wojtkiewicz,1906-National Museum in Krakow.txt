A Polish artist, Witold Wojtkiewicz created a series of compositions that exude pessimism, dominated by an atmosphere of apathy and despair. Wojtkiewicz’s paintings are filled with disturbing figures, ones who live in a repulsive world of childish elders and ugly children. These figures are the protagonists of a somnambulistic vision, which the artist recreates in Fantazja. The composition is dominated by the orange color of the wall; on this background a mysterious figure appears (with a macabre head, resembling a skull), dressed in a Cracovian bodice worn over a semi-fibrous robe. Through the gate further figures can be seen, and it is difficult to interpret the scene that is being played out there on the background of another wall. The mood of depression and anxiety is enhanced by a bundle of dry branches, clearly visible on the brick wall. This intriguing, almost predatory atmosphere is characteristic for Wojtkiewicz, who once confessed to his friend Eliza Parenska that “cruel exaggeration is my spiritual lover, smeared in glaring (…) colours (…), perfumed with tears of anger”.
You know, we are preparing ourselves to launch the Polish language version of DailyArt; so we will feature from time to time some gloomy Polish paintings. ; ) 
We present today's painting thanks to the National Museum in Krakow. : )
P.S. Don't worry, the museum also holds in its collection many world-famous masterpieces! Read about Leonardo's Lady with an Ermine here!
