We continue to wish you all the best in 2020 with this allegorical representation of abundance. Yes, the central character is so fertile she has six breasts!
This type of allegorical representations of abundance or fecundity was very popular among cabinet paintings from this period. Here, fertility is represented by a six-breasted figure at the center of the composition. She holds a horn of plenty and is accompanied by four children who may represent the four seasons. Nature’s abundant offerings surround her, including both flora—numerous species of trees, flowers, and fruit—and fauna, including domesticated and wild mammals, exotic animals, reptiles, insects, fish, and crustaceans.
