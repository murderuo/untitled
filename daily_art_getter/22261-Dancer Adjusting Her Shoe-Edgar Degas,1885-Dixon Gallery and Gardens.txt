On this day in 1834, Edgar Degas, one of the Impressionists especially identified with the subject of dance, was born. 
The work we present today, Dancer Adjusting Her Shoe, was created in the mid-1880s, when Degas was at the height of his powers. As only one of his mastery with charcoal and pastel could achieve, the work is a spontaneously executed sketch, but still has the bearing of a fully resolved work of graphic art. The sureness of his hand allowed Degas to capture a young dancer, adjusting her slipper and absently scratching her arm, with all the resolution necessary to give the work its expressive power.
