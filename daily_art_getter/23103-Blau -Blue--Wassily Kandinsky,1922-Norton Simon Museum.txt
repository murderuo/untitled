Wassily Kandinsky was a Russian painter and art theorist. He is generally credited as the pioneer of abstract art. In his art he was very much inspired by music. Writing that "music is the ultimate teacher," he also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind (synesthesia). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that (for example) yellow is the color of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the color of closure and the end of things; and that combinations of colors produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. 
Kandinsky made these works when he was a teacher at the Bauhaus, the innovative and influential modernist art and architecture school in Germany. His work during this period was characterized by precise lines and dense groups of simple geometric shapes arranged without any central focus. In his writings Kandinsky analyzed the geometrical elements and the various ways that their color, placement, and interaction could affect the viewer, both physically and spiritually. He considered the circle to be the most elementary form, possessing a cosmic meaning.
