During the period between the World Wars, Meštrovic was influenced by neoclassical tendencies, inspired by the spirit of the Mediterranean, so he produced many female figures in white stone or in marble. Today these works are considered to be the most important in his oeuvre.
One of them is Contemplation—a sculpture full of mindfulness, introverted, with a closed and compact form, but with delicate lines from which the shapes of the female body emerge. In the face of the portrayed woman we can recognize the features of Olga Meštrovic, the artist's second wife.
This sculpture is from the collection of the Ivan Meštrovic Museums in Zagreb and Split. It is currently on view in Kraków (Poland) at the International Centre of Culture Gallery (until the 5th of November 2017).
