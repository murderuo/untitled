Giorgio Vasari, the famous Mannerism artist and the author of a series of artist biographies, wrote about this masterpiece: "He painted in tempera, as a companion to this work, a Nativity of Christ which must excite the wonder of every thinking man, introducing his own portrait and some heads of shepherds, which are considered divine." 
The painting is displayed in the altarpiece in the Sassetti Chapel in Santa Trinita church in Florence. The chapel is consecrated to the birth of Christ, and as a result much in the chapel is conceived with that event in mind. This composition of the painting was so successful that other artists frequently repeated it. Ghirlandaio himself appears in the scene, dressed as a shepherd. He is even allowed to come closer to the Christ Child than the donors, who appear in chapel's frescoes to the right and left, praying outside the confines of the panel. The artist, who is leading the shepherds, is kneeling and bringing the miracle of the birth of Christ to the attention of both the shepherds and the observers of the picture. 
The adoration of the shepherds was a very popular theme north of the Alps in the 15th century. Ghirlandaio learned about the subject in 1483 when Thomas Portinari, a Medici representative working in Flanders, brought a work by Hugo van der Goes to Florence.
