The girl in this painting is the most beautiful fairy ever. She has a set of wings and a crown of butterflies to prove it.
Her lovely image is the work of 19th-century French-English artist Sophie Gengembre Anderson (1823-1903). Anderson made a whole career of painting idealized children, especially beautiful girls. She portrayed peasant children in rural landscapes, wealthy children in comfortable homes, and ethereal figures from myth and literature. The fairy in this painting may have been inspired by a poem by Charles Ede.
I think that the detail, color, and naturalism together make this painting so spectacular. The fairy’s luminous face and hair, her diaphanous white robe with gold trim, and vivid crown are highlights among the pale greens of the overall composition. The hint of an otherworldly setting appearing in an atmospheric mist behind the figure also contributes greatly to the mood. Because her skill with the brush is so obvious, it’s surprising to learn that Anderson was primarily self taught.
Anderson’s themes were popular in 19th-century European art movements like Romanticism and the Pre-Raphaelites. She was successful in her time, but her pretty and sentimental works did not age well in the 20th century. She might be experiencing a comeback, however, because one of her paintings sold for over a million British pounds in 2008.
