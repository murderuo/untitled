Today is the first day of 2019. I tried very hard to look for something suitable, like a painting with someone resting after a party, or a good symbol for the new year. But I gave up. It was too hard. 
So what we present to you today is this handsome Canadian otter! John Woodhouse Audubon was the second son of the artist/naturalist John James Audubon. At an early age he showed artistic promise and was encouraged to join his father in his scientific interests. In 1833 he accompanied his father on an expedition to Labrador. Later that same year John James was able to write, "John has drawn a few Birds, as good as any I ever made, and in a few months I hope to give this department of my duty up to him altogether".
When I look at this otter I smell fish. 
Have some proper rest today and see you tomorrow! :)

P.S. I love animals in art. It's no secret that my favourite is cats but on the contrary, today I recommend you our selection of dogs in art :)
