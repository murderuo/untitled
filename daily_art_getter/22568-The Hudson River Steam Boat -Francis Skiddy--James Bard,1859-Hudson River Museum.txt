James Bard was a marine artist of the 19th century. He is known for his paintings of watercraft, particularly of steamboats. His works are sometimes characterized as naïve art. Although Bard died poor and almost forgotten, his works have since become valuable. Bard had a twin brother, John, and they collaborated on earlier works.
This painting’s meticulous detail and the lengthy inscription that James Bard placed on the painting celebrates and documents the handsome vessel. The artist specialized in “ship portraits” his entire career, working near the Manhattan piers to be close to potential clients. The Hudson River is the backdrop that Bard frequently chose; here he embellishes the Francis Skiddy with a painting within a painting—a miniature view of the Hudson Highlands on its paddlewheel box.
