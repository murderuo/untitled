Until June 30th (2019), in our very favorite Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, you can visit an amazing Mark Rothko exhibition. Among the masterpieces there you can see the one we present today. Enjoy!  : )
Mark Rothko once said: "I’m interested only in expressing basic human emotions – tragedy, ecstasy, doom and so on – and the fact that lots of people break down and cry when confronted with my pictures shows that I communicate those basic human emotions (…) The people who weep before my pictures are having the same religious experience I had when I painted them. And if you, as you say, are moved only by their color relationships, then you miss the point!"
Color is certainly an important part of Rothko’s oeuvre. As the artist goes through the 1950s and into the 1960s, his paintings keep getting wider and almost fully envelop us, demanding our full attention. He sought to create his own version of this solitary meditative experience, scaling his pictures so that the viewer is enveloped in their subtly shifting, atmospheric surface.
P.S. Early Rothko’s paintings will surprise you. See them and learn more here.
