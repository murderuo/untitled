Julia Beck was a Swedish painter and calligrapher. As you may know, we do our best to promote women artists; we present this beautiful Julia Beck landscape thanks to the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm.  : )
Water lily motifs influenced by Japanese art were popular at the turn of the century. As early as 1888, the open-air painter Julia Beck created a series of pastel-colored studies in Normandy, France. The forest and river landscapes fascinated her, especially the hazy multicolored light in the Risle River. The impressionist Claude Monet painted his first water lily the following year, 1889, and ten years later he started his series from Giverny.
P.S. You can find Julia Beck's work among these five self-portraits by women artists that you probably haven’t seen!
