Saint Cecilia, the patron of musicians, is shown at an organ, the instrument that became her attribute in the sixteenth century.
The construction of the painting on diagonal lines and the rejection of the classic frontal pose constitute an exception in the work of Sassoferrato, as are the details of the refined brooch and of the inscription on the page.
The saintâ€™s features derive from the female figures of Guido Reni but they are not so much a close copy as a reinterpretation. Sassoferrato, like many other artists of his time, used to refer to the works of painters from the early Renaissance or the Bolognese classicism of the early seventeenth century, changing the size or the composition.
We present today's painting thanks to Museo Poldi Pezzoli in Milan :)Saint Cecilia is usually shown at an organ, if you want to learn about other saints' attributes read this article at DailyArt Magazine.
