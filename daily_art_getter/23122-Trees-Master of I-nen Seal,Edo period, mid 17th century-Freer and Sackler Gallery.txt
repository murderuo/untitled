At least eight varieties of trees have been identified in the screens, reflecting a growing interest at that time among educated Japanese in natural history classification. Yet even with careful attention to botanical accuracy, the painter offers no suggestion of spatial relationship between the trees. Indeed, the real subject of the painting is jarring contrast: realism in form but not space, dramatic asymmetry, and bold color contrast.
The circular vermilion seals, reading "I'nen" and seen on the extreme left and right panels of this screen set, were used by the Kyoto painter Tawaraya Sotatsu (active circa 1600–1640) and by several generations of his followers. Sotatsu's follower, Sosetsu (active 1630–1650) is a strong candidate as the user of these "I'nen" seals. He migrated from Kyoto to serve Lord Maeda, head of the family who ruled Kaga Province, north of Kyoto; these screens were likely commissioned for the Maeda family.
We present today's beautiful trees thanks to the Freer and Sackler Gallery.
P.S. It's not widely known but Gustave Klimt, the famous author of The Kiss, loved to paint trees! See these luminous and colorful paintings here!
