For the next two weeks every Sunday we will present masterpieces created by two great artists - the sculptor French Auguste Rodin and the Polish artist Xavery Dunikowski. All of them depict women. To find more about the exhibition in National Museum in Krakow that compares the work of these two artists, see the link below. Enjoy! :)Dramatically emphasized is the relation of the new life to the mother in the sculpture depicting the mother staggering and drooping like a withering, rotting leaf, while the child erupting off her side blooms as a soaring plant shoot. (Stefan Szuman)In the work of both sculptors, Rodin and Dunikowski, we will find portraits of women as a commentary on the meaning of human existence and passing, often depicted in naturalistic manner. They both undertook themes emerging towards the end of the 19th and in the early 20th century in culture, philosophy, literature and art. Related to the processes of reproduction, the birth of new life. In Dunikowski’s art there is more fascination with the motif od maternity and changes occurring in the body of a pregnant woman.In his work Maternity, the artist depicted two human bodies merged in a homogenous whole, as if two bodies were coming out of one. Help us and donate so we will be able to release the new version of DailyArt this autumn: http://support.getdailyart.com
