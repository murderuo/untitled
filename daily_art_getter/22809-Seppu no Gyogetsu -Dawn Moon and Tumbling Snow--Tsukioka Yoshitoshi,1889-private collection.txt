This print is part of Yoshitoshi's famous series "100 Aspects of the Moon" which depicts scenes from traditional Chinese and Japanese history and lore. Kobayashi Heihachiro, disguised as a maid, bursts in to defend his lord from the revengeful attack of the Ronin in this final scene from the kabuki play "Chushingura" (Attack on Morono's Mansion). Although eventually defeated, his great courage at the focus of this piece as he is outnumbered by the Ronin four to one.
I love many things about Japanese prints. One of them is how they depicted snow and winter. So pure and beautiful :) You can find them here!
