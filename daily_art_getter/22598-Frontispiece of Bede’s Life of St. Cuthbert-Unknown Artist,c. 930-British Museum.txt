Of the many Anglo-Saxon kings of England’s various, and later united, kingdoms, Athelstan (r. 924-939) was a monarch of many important firsts. Although he successfully built upon a foundation laid by his father, Edward the Elder, and grandfather, the famous Alfred the Great, King Athelstan is credited as the first English king to successfully unite all Anglo-Saxon-speaking peoples on the island, identifying himself conspicuously as King of all Britain on his coinage in the 930s. His patronage was, unsurprisingly, vigorously sought by laymen and churchmen alike, and, likely through the intercession of a small monastic community temporarily living at Chester-le-Street in northern England, he became particularly interested in St. Cuthbert, a 7th-century figure who was famous for his holy life, his miracles, and his incorrupt body.
According to a chronicler writing in the early 12th century, King Athelstan visited the Chester-le-Street monks to ask for St. Cuthbert’s blessing in the 930s, and he “gave [the saint] for the adornment of his church, many different kinds of gifts worthy of a king.” Among these precious donations was the book that contains this image, an illuminated manuscript of the story of St. Cuthbert’s life written by Bede. The frontispiece of this manuscript features King Athelstan, bowing in supplication, presenting this book to the saint himself standing before his church and offering his support. Eagerly accepted by the community, and likely on display there in the medieval period, this image is the first portrait of any English king in existence today, displaying King Athelstan’s wealth and power while also emphasizing his humility before God’s holy witness.
