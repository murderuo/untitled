From March 8 to June 3, 2018, The Rijksmuseum presents a magnificent exhibition, High Society, covering four centuries of glamour in portrait art by the great masters of the history of art, including Cranach, Veronese, Velázquez, Reynolds, Gainsborough, Sargent, Munch, and Manet. You can read more about this great show here. If you can't visit Amsterdam, however, we have something special for you—we will feature a couple of great portraits from the exhibition in DailyArt. Like today!
Marten (today) and Oopjen (yesterday) are the only couple that Rembrandt painted life-size, standing, and at full-length. Marten’s father came to Amsterdam from Antwerp as a Protestant refugee. He made his fortune as the owner of a sugar refinery. Marten married Oopjen in 1633. He was 20 and a law student, ready for a career in politics. Sadly, he died a mere eight years later. If you swipe left you will see Oopjen's portrait also painted by Rembrandt, which we featured yesterday. :)
