George Stubbs (1724-1806) was an English artist mostly known for his portraits of animals. He was fascinated with anatomy and studied at York Hospital to become adept at anatomically correct painting, engravings, and illustrations. He was especially known for his superb renditions of horses as illustrated in his publication “The Anatomy of the Horse in 1766” which was considered a masterful reference on equine anatomy. He worked in all scales sometimes producing large works as seen in “White Poodle in a Punt” (1780) which was painted on a 4’ x 3’ canvas. In this portrait, we see a white dog with dense, curly hair standing in a punt (an English boat used on ponds and rivers). Tall, hazy trees loom in the background and surround the water but the poodle is the main attraction. The dog looks at the viewer with an expression that is up for debate. Poodles originally were water dogs known for their retrieving skills, especially ducks. The dog’s expression seems to be a disdainful look from one who has been told: “No, you must stay on the boat.” For a dog, who loves the water and retrieving ducks, this would be a hard command to obey. Whatever your interpretation, it is a delightful painting where man’s best friend takes center stage. In the 1770’s Stubbs’s reputation as a painter wilted as he was considered mainly a portraitist of animals. He did adopt the more popular genre of rural paintings but remained best known for his animal portraits. Stubbs was denied acceptance into The Royal Academy as they said his work “lacked vigor of subject.” Certainly, Stubbs would feel vindicated to know that his white poodle portrait currently hangs on the wall of the National Gallery in Washington, D.C.
