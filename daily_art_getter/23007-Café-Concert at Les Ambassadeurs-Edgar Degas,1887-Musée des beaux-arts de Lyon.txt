This is one of the most well-known pastels by Edgar Degas. The artist first presented it in 1877 at the fourth exhibition of the Impressionist group. The striking composition of this musical performance places the spectator among the people in the orchestra section in the shadowed foreground. The eye is attracted beyond the musicians to the singer in a red dress, who is strongly illuminated by the footlights. Degas' mastery of scenic effects tied to artificial lighting, an original composition, and his virtuosity with pastel reinforce the lively aspect of this scene, which seems to have been drawn on the spot.Â
