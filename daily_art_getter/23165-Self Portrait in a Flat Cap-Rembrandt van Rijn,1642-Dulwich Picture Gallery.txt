October marks 350 years since the Dutch painter Rembrandt van Rijn died in Amsterdam in 1669. Here, in Self Portrait in a Flat Cap, the painter depicts himself in dramatic shades of black velvet, deep mauves, purples, and golds.
Light, falling from the left, illuminates Rembrandt’s focused gaze, while casting the lower half of his face in shadow. Painted in 1642, the same year as his large-scale masterpiece The Night Watch, Rembrandt chose to present himself as a mature artist at the peak of his career, having completed this important and very public commission. 
You can see this work and other masterpieces on display in Rembrandt’s Light; a cinematic retelling of the Dutch master’s pivotal years, at the Dulwich Picture Gallery until 2 February 2020.
P.S. Here's 15 things you may not know about The Night Watch!
