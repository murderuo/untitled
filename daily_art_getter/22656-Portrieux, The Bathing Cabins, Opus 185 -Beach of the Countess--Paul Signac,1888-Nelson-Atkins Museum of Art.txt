Paul Signac was the principal follower of Seurat and also produced a large number of pointillist marine paintings. This luminous work is one of a number of ocean views Signac made during the summer of 1888 at Portrieux, a small seaside resort on the north coast of Brittany. He represents the bathing cabins in the stillness of the early morning before the beach has been transformed by the arrival of tourists. The scene is animated by touches of pure color, as in the red cabin steps. The inscription "Op. 185" reflects Signac's practice of giving his paintings opus numbers in the fashion of musical compositions.
I wish I could be on that beach now and sunbathing!If you are in a summer mood go to the beach with Salvador Dalí.
