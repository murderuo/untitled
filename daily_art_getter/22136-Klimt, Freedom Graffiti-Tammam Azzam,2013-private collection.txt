Tammam Azzam, is a Syrian-born artist who lives and works in Dubai. The work we present today went viral a couple of months ago when London’s Saatchi Gallery shared it on its Facebook. It is Gustav Klimt’s The Kiss, digitally superimposed on a photograph of a bullet-ridden wall in an unidentified part of Syria.
Azzam started to do digital art, because of one simple reason — when he was forced to leave Syria he lacked studio space and materials. 
Freedom Graffiti is part of a larger concept, which Azzam produced in response to his country’s struggle, titled ‘Syrian Museum’. The anti-war digital artworks play on other iconic paintings from artists such as da Vinci, Matisse and Picasso set against images of a Syria in ruins. Regarding this piece Azzam said: “I chose it as an icon of love, a way of looking for the stories of love behind this wall that was completely obliterated by the machinery of war”.
