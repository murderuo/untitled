Today we would like to present a Japanese print from the National Museum in Krakow. Until May 3rd it will be exhibited in the"ONNA - Beauty, Strength, Ecstasy" exhibition :)`
This series of prints alludes to the beauty of snow, moon and flowers, three concepts which are associated in Japanese culture with much more than just natural phenomena. Each of the three prints in this series depicts an oiran, a beautiful courtesan, and a furisode shinzo — her younger companion who has the privilege of wearing the long-sleeved kimono, furisode, but is not yet allowed to have her own room. 
The main character of this scene, Hanazuma, of the renowned Hyogoya Isuke House, belonged to the highest class of courtesans known as yobidashi. They received clients outside the brothel in which they worked. The popular courtesan was usually attended by two kamuro girls, who accompanied her on her walks and in parades. Their names, Sakura and Nioi, are written on this sheet next to Hanzauma’s name.
 
In this print, Hanazuma adjusts a stick in her hair and her companion holds in her lap a young hare, an animal traditionally associated with the moon. Miscanthus placed in a vase is a clear autumnal accent and a reference to tsukimi – the custom of celebrating the autumn full moon.
