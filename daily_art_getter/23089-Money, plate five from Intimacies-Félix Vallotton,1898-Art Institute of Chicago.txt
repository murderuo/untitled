I love Félix Vallotton. 
From the moment they were printed, the series of woodcuts with the title Intimités was considered to be a prestigious project. Among his fellow printmakers, Félix Vallotton was one of the most renowned artists. He was recognized as an innovator of the medium of the woodcut and his prints dating from 1896 to 1898 are the culmination of his career.
Intimacies has always been recognized as his most impressive work and even in his own time they were already more appreciated than Vallotton's paintings. With these ten dark woodcuts, their black surfaces cut through by a few white lines, the artist probed the emotional lives of the Paris bourgeoisie. He portrayed the eternal struggle between man and woman by means of theatrical scenes and suggestive titles, such as The Lie, The Money and The Irreparable. Vallotton brought to the surface his cynical view on love. Women are portrayed as superficial, calculating creatures: cruel, insatiable and triumphing.
