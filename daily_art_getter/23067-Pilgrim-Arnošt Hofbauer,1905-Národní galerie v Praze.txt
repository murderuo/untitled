Arnošt Hofbauer, painter and notable graphic artist, is from the strong generation of 1890s artists. They were naturally inspired by Parisian art, responding to contemporary artistic tendencies from Impressionism to the decorative Art Nouveau to dreamy Symbolism. Pilgrim (1905) refers to the latter. A figure that is slowly walking to the stone sanctuary (dolmen) is followed by a black panther. This motif corresponds to the period in literature as well, to a figure of a lonely roaming artist who is finding his place in the contemporary world, yet to no avail. It may have been inspired by the Wandering Jew theme that appeared in art of that time rather frequently.
We present today's painting thanks to the National Gallery Prague.
P.S. Let’s set off for a journey from the Czech Republic to Paris with another Czech artist, Josef Šíma!
