You can see the Inspired by Rembrandt. 100 Years of Collecting by The Rembrandt House Museum exhibition at the Rembrandt House Museum in Amsterdam until 1 September 2019.  There, you can see this fantastic etching by Pablo Picasso!  : )
This is a simple sketch sheet with single drawings, just as Rembrandt made them. Picasso even drew Rembrandt’s portrait, including the typical beret with feather and his curly hair with just a couple of swift dashes. The master of abstraction made more than 2,500 prints in various techniques, often borrowing motifs from famous artists. He undoubtedly felt drawn to Rembrandt’s idiosyncratic style. 
Have a great Saturday!
