Today is our last Sunday with the paintings from the collection of the National Gallery in Prague.  We hope you enjoyed them! : )
In the second half of the 1890s, Antonín Hudecek joined the group of students in Julius Mařák’s landscape painting studio at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague and practiced plein air painting in Okoř village near Prague during the summer. In the company of Antonín Slavícek and Otakar Lebeda, he produced many canvases there that are regarded as the key works of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, including Evening Silence, in which Hudecek achieved the balanced connection of the landscape and figure. The figure of a young woman draws the spectator into the canvas to enjoy with her the atmosphere of the early summer evening as well as the feeling of melancholy.
