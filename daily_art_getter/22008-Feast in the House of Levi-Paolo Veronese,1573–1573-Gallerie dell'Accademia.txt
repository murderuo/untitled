This great painting, which was taken to Paris by Napoleon and then returned in 1815, was originally a “Last Supper” for the refectory of the convent of Santi Giovanni e Paolo as a replacement for a ”Last Supper” by Titian. According to the writing at the base of the pillar bottom left, the work was completed on April 20, 1573. Three months later the artist was accused of heresy for this vast composition which contained what were considered to be excessive anti-conformist elements. In spite of his strong defence of his artistic freedom Veronese was ordered to "correct" the painting at his own expense within three months. But the only change he made was to add the writing of the top of the pillar with the date below, clearly at the suggestion of "Dominican scholars: fecit D.Covi Magnum Levi - Luca Cap. V," so as to avoid a scandal. In fact, Luke says in chapter V of his Gospel: "Levi held a great banquet for the Lord." In the work, with its triple-arch background inspired by the buildings of Palladio and Sansovino, Veronese's research into the idea of the banquet is concluded, with the attainment of a complete balance of scenic elements and figures.Help us and donate so we will be able to release the new version of DailyArt this autumn: http://support.getdailyart.com
