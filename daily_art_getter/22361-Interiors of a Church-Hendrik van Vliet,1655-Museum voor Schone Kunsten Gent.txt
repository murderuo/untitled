We present todayâ€™s painting thanks to Museum voor Schone Kunsten Gent. Hope you will like it:)
While the Delft painter Hendrik van Vliet was primarily concerned with the monumentality of his imaginary architecture, a narrative aspect was also important. A woman sits with a child on her lap. This young woman (possibly a widow) forms an interesting contrast with the open grave in the foreground. In the play of light and shadow, and in the depiction of the tomb, there lies a reference to the transience of life as described in the book of Job: Our days on earth are as fleeting as a shadow.
