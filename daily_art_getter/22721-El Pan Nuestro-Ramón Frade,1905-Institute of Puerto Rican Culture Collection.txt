Friends, today we have a painting and a message from one of our followers, Daniel from Puerto Rico:
"For some time now I’ve wanted to suggest a painting that represents Puerto Rico, my home, and now more than ever I believe my suggestion is appropriate.  Puerto Rico is in a really fragile state right now. We’re currently living a very hard lifestyle in my home after hurricanes Irma and María, the two strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic ocean, both hit Puerto Rico in September of last year. Many people were left without power for months and running water was a hit or miss depending on the day.
Despite this, the tenacity of our people has really shined bright against the darkness that the disaster has left. I believe that this tenacity is also evidenced through our jíbaro roots. Puerto Rican jíbaros were the country farmers, the land workers of the recent past. This painting is titled El pan nuestro or “Our Daily Bread” and refers to the facts of everyday life. This painting shows an example of the everyday lifestyle and hardness that our jíbaro ancestors lived through.
The painting’s artist is Ramón Frade, who was one of the most important Puerto Rican artists at the beginning of the 20th century. He was a painter, photographer, and architect. He was also born in Cayey, the same city as I lived during my time in the island. 
Please display this beautiful painting and help me communicate the hardships that the great people of Puerto Rico are living right now. Also, feel free to search and donate to foundations that help the Puerto Rican people, the tenacious jíbaros of today that are trying to survive the hardships of tomorrow."
These are some of the foundations that can be donated to:
Puerto Rico Recovery Fund
Unidos: A Relief Fund for Hurricane Maria Victims in Puerto Rico
See you tomorrow!
