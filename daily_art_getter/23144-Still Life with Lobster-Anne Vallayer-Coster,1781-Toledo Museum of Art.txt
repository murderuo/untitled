We continue our month with Toledo Museum of Art - that means that every Sunday this month we will present a piece from their collection. Enjoy! :) 
One of only four women to be admitted to the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture before the French Revolution, Anne Vallayer-Coster was an accomplished still life artist with the patronage of Marie-Antoinette. This canvas and its pendant, Still Life with Game, also in TMA's collection, were painted the year Vallayer-Coster was appointed a painter to the queen.
The silver objects in Still Life with Lobster are likely the work of Vallayer-Coster's silversmith father. A reflection in the tureen seems to reveal the artist's studio window and the artist herself painting at her easel.
The frame and that of Still Life with Game are contemporary to the paintings and marked by the framemaker Erienne-Louis Infroit (1720–1794).
P.S. If you're hungry don't open these links with adorable food compositions- cheese and asparagus ;)
