Pieter Claesz was a Dutch Golden Age painter of still lifes. Magnificent work, isn't it?
This banketje (little banquet) features not only an imposing turkey pie, but various other items of food and drink often portrayed in still lifes: a glass of wine, oysters, a half-pared lemon, a rolled-up page from an almanac filled with pepper. The gleaming wine jug is a masterpiece of reflection. In the body of the jug we see not only a window and part of the laid table, but also the shadowy figure of the painter behind his easel. This still life, dating from 1627, is painted in vibrant colors. It was not until the 1630s that monochromatic still lifes became popular.
