Carolus-Duran was among the most celebrated portrait painters working in Paris in the 1870s. With his casual pose and elegant clothing, he is presented as a dandy or fashionable man-about-town. On his lapel he wears the red pin of the French Legion of Honour, awarded for his contribution to the arts. John Singer Sargent, an American expatriate artist, considered the leading portrait painter of his generation, studied with Carolus-Duran, launching his own career by exhibiting this portrait to great acclaim. Along the top, he added an inscription paying homage to his teacher and describing himself as an “affectionate pupil.”
That's an amazing portrait, isn't it?  We present today's painting thanks to The Clark <3 
P.S. One of our favorite portraits by Sargent is this one, depicting a dandy, gynecologist, and notorious womanizer: Dr. Pozzi! : )
