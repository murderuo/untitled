We present today's painting thanks to the Art Gallery of Hamilton—thank you! :)Born in France and living in England during the 1870s, James Tissot is best known for his pictures of fashionably dressed women in London and Paris during the late Victorian era. Croquet has long been one of the most sought-after paintings at the Art Gallery of Hamilton and an excellent example of the artist’s tendency to represent his subjects with a unique blend of narrative realism and ornamental effects.Beautiful, isn't it? :)see you tomorrow!Zuzanna
