This painting entered the Uffizi collection in 1932. An inscription on the back of the painting allows us to identify the subject as Maria Adelaide, daughter of Louis XV and sister of Luisa Elisabetta, Duchess of Parma. Liotard, a portrait artist of Swiss origin but trained in France, lived in Constantinople and in Vienna. He often represented his subjects in exotic costumes.
Have a great and calm Thursday - maybe it's a good day to read some book? :)
