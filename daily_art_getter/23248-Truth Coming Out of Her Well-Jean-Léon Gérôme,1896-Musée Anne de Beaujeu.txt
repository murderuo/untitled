I know it is a very weird painting.
Beginning in the mid-1890s, in the last decade of his life, Gérôme made at least four paintings personifying Truth as a nude woman, either thrown into, at the bottom of, or emerging from a well. The imagery arises from a translation of an aphorism of the philosopher Democritus, "Of truth we know nothing, for truth is in a well". The nudity of the model may arise from the expression "la vérité nue, "the naked truth."
It has been assumed that the painting was a comments on the Dreyfus affair, but some art historians argue that Gérôme's images of Truth and the well were part of his ongoing diatribe against Impressionism, which is kinda funny.
The multiplie interpretations of the painting's enigmatic meaning prompted one of the museum's curators to say, "This is our Mona Lisa."
We leave you with this weirdness and a small remark, that art history is full of anegdotes. See you tomorrow and watch out the wells!
