Exactly on this day SEVEN years ago DailyArt was published in the Apple App Store and on Google Play. :)
We, the whole DailyArt team, would like to thank you SO MUCH for being with us, for all your support, emails, and kind words. We would not be here without you. I need to thank especially our volunteers, who help us: write the texts, edit them, and for the past couple of weeks, translate them to Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, and Turkish. 
Thank you, friends! :) On this occasion, our in-app purchase will cost $1.99 instead of $4.99. :)
But back to the regular stuff :D
Flowering trees were special to van Gogh. They represented awakening and hope. He enjoyed them aesthetically and found joy in painting flowering trees. Van Gogh borrowed the subject, the bold outlines, and the positioning of the tree in the picture plane from Japanese printmaking. 
The painting was a gift for his brother Theo and sister-in-law Jo, who had just had a baby son, Vincent Willem. In the letter announcing the new arrival, Theo wrote: “As we told you, we’ll name him after you, and I’m making the wish that he may be as determined and as courageous as you.” 
So, let's start our eighth year! :)
