This beautiful example of Russian art until 9 March 2020 can be seen of the State Russian Museum's exhibition, Ilya Repin. To the 175th Anniversary of the Artist's Birth, on view. If you're in Petersburg, don't miss it!
Among other Repin's masterpieces is one of the most dynamic in composition — a portrait of Anton Rubinstein, an outstanding pianist, composer, founder and Director of the St. Petersburg Conservatory, who gave concerts in Western Europe and the United States.
"An interesting head, like a lion," Repin wrote about him to V. V. Stasov, a well-known art music critic, with whom the artist listened to concerts under the baton of Rubinstein many times. Anton Rubinstein (1829–1894) was a leading Russian pianist and composer. He founded the St Petersburg Conservatoire and often performed in Western Europe and the United States. Here you can listen to his music :)
See you tomorrow!
