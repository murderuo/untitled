A man, with a brush and palette in his hand, has brought a painting canvas to an unusual place. The man is Edvard Munch, and the year 1907. He had been suffering from recurring crisis, and in Warnemünde he hoped to recover from his very complicated relationship with his former mistress Tulla Larsen. The photograph shows how Munch believed that a healthy life under the sun in a beach resort would bring back his vitality. It was, actually, a common belief and a fashion of time to spend summers naked outdoors in harmony with nature, and even without women’s interruption. It was sad, however, that Munch did not get rid of his demons in Warnemünde. This happened only after a nervous breakdown and treatment at Dr. Jacobson’s clinic in Copenhagen in 1908-09.
