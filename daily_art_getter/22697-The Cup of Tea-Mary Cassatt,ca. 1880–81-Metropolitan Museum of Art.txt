Mary Cassatt, one of the French Impressionists, presented this painting in the 1881 Impressionist exhibition. The artist was famous for portraying the ordinary events of everyday life like we see here. Taking afternoon tea was a social ritual for many upper-middle-class women. Cassatt the artist made that ritual the subject of a series of works painted around 1880 when she had been living abroad for the better part of a decade. Her model for this canvas was her sister, Lydia, who had moved to Paris, along with their parents, in 1877 and often posed for her. 
Looks like it's tea time! While sipping your cup of black or green check out Mary Cassatt’s feminist mural which has gone lost.
