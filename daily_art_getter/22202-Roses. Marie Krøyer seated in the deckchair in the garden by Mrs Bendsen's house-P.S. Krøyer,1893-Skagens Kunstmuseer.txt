Peder Severin Krøyer first came to Skagen in the summer of 1882. His enthusiasm for the countryside and environment, and not least the company of the other artists caused him to return almost every summer. In 1889, Krøyer married the artist Marie Triepcke. In 1894, the couple were permitted to rent and rebuild the old town recorder's residence in Skagen's Plantation – which is known today as Krøyer's House. The following year, Marie gave birth to their daughter, Vibeke. She stayed with her father in Skagen when Marie and Krøyer were divorced in 1906. Krøyer was already a famous artist when he first came to Skagen, and his presence attracted attention to the artists' colony in Skagen. In the summer, many artists would gather to work and celebrate there – and many of the celebrations were held on the initiative of Krøyer, who thoroughly enjoyed conviviality. Krøyer is known and loved mostly for his pictures from Skagen. In the pictures, he portrays the carefree life of the artists, their festive meals, walks on the beach and evocative moonlit evenings. At the beginning of the 20th century, Krøyer was admitted to the insane asylum at Middelfart several times, probably suffering from a manic-depressive psychosis. The illness weakened his health, and he died at the age of 58 in November 1909. He was buried at Skagen Cemetery.
