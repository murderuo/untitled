Russian folk painter Marc Chagall’s first sentiment upon arriving in Paris in 1911 was that he wanted to return home immediately, so overwhelmed was he by the French capital. This soon changed, and Paris became a revelation for Chagall. “I seemed to be discovering light, color, freedom, the sun, and the joy of living for the first time,” he said, and referred to the twin impressions that shaped his future painting as “lumière-liberté” (light-liberty). It was in Paris that he saw, “as in a vision, the kind of art that I actually wanted to create.” It was a vision owing a great deal to the fragmentation of cubism. The result of this artistic awakening can be perceived in his paintings, in the synthesis of lyrical color contrasts and cubist-inspired geometric compositions. Chagall also painted Couple amoureux in Paris in 1925.
This painting can be seen at the Stedelijk Museum's latest exhibition—Chagall, Picasso, Mondrian and Others: Migrant Artists in Paris. It presents art from the superb collection of the Stedelijk Museum, and includes work by more than 50 artists, photographers, and graphic designers. The show ends on 2 February 2020; don't miss it!
Thanks to such features I really love my work.
