In this work, Mary Cassatt addressed the theme for which she is best known—women and children—while also experimenting with compositional elements of Japanese art. Cassatt saw a large exhibition of Japanese prints at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1890, and produced a series of prints influenced by their aesthetics. The Child’s Bath is the culmination of her investigation of a flattened picture plane and decorative patterning. The intimate scene of everyday life also echoes the subject of many Japanese prints. In Cassatt’s painting, the encircling arms and gentle touch of the mother or nurse convey an overall feeling of protection and tenderness.
P.S. One of my favorite Cassatt paintings shows a little girl in a blue armchair accompanied by a puppy. You can see it here. Be careful! Sweetness overload!  : )
P.P.S. Guys, we are looking for French translators, who would like to volunteer and help us to speed up translating DailyArts. We are looking for people who had done some translations before, are native speakers in their language and know English on c1/c2 level. If you're interested, please contact Ela, here :)
