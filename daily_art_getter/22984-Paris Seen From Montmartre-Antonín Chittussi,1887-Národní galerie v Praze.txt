Today we start our adventure with Czech art! Every Sunday this month we will present pieces from the collection of National Gallery in Prague. Enjoy! : )
Chittussi spent the first half of 1887 in France. The committee of the Paris Salon refused his view of Paris roofs that dominate the Opera and the dome of Les Invalides, and Chittussi exhibited it at an art dealer on the Avenue de l'Op√©ra instead. After the experience, he never entered another painting at the Salon and this picture of his beloved city was his artist's good-bye to France. Several detailed sketches confirm Chittussi's thorough preparations and emphasize the importance of this painting for him personally. The careful painting and the special matter-of-fact rendering of the city inspired future generations of artists.
Have a great Sunday!
P.S. There are many wonderful depictions of Montmartre; see them here!
