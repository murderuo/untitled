At age 68, Monet and his wife went to Venice. While reluctant to paint the subjects that had been painted so many times by other artists, the artist had not intended to create any paintings while staying there. But, when he arrived, he became entranced with the sights in Venice. He sent for his painting materials, and in October 1908, began painting a series of preliminary works, one of which was San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk.  
Every evening in late November 1908, Monet and his wife made gondola trips to enjoy “these splendid sunsets which are unique in the world.” 
In case you want to look through the eyes of Claude Monet, go there.
