The title of today's painting, Diary of a Seducer, is a phrase that Arshile Gorky took from Soren Kierkegaard, the existential philosopher. Although you may not see it at first glance, there's a lot of biological and sexual imagery within this painting. They can be hard to decode, but we encourage you to have a closer look.
Gorky studied modern artists and most particularly the greatest of the 20th century, Picasso. He was also a close friend of the artist Willem de Kooning, and each had a significant influence on the other. Yesterday we featured a piece by Kandinsky, whom Gorky called his master. You can easily see the similarities here. 
See you tomorrow! Â 
(No more abstract art this week, I promise:)

P.S. Although if you like it maybe you feel like watching some Pollock!
