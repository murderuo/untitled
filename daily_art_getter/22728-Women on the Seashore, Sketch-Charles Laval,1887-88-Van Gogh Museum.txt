We present today's painting thanks to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, where until January 13th you can see the exhibition Gauguin & Laval in Martinique.
Discontent with what they considered to be the decadent Parisian way of life, Paul Gauguin (1848–1903) and Charles Laval (1861–1894) travelled to the French island of Martinique. In the short time that they stayed on the exotic Caribbean island, they created a series of exquisite artworks. The trip had a huge impact on their further artistic development.
Gauguin & Laval in Martinique features a wide selection of the warm, colorful paintings created by Gauguin and Laval on the island, together with their preparatory studies and large, elaborate pastels. This is the first time that so many works from their Martinican period are being displayed together.
It is also clear to see that Laval primarily focused on the figures. The women are relatively very large and detailed, while the background is simplified. For Laval, a simple semicircle sufficed for the beach, and he also opted for a simplified depiction of the mountains.
P.S. In the Van Gogh Muzeum you can see one of three versions of the famous van Gogh’s Bedroom, check it here!
