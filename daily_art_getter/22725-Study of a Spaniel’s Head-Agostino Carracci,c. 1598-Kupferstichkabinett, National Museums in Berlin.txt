This is one of the most amazing drawings of a dog in the history of art! This study of a spaniel’s head captures an array of charming details: the animal’s long, hanging ears covered in curly fur; its faithful eyes gazing upwards; and its white and black fur. Although the animal’s likeness was evidently drawn from nature with tremendous, loving attention to detail, we should hesitate from assuming the work was intended as a portrait. Maybe of the artist's dog, who knows?
See you tomorrow!
