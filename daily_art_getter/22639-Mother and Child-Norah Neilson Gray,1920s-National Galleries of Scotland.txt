After World War I, Gray built up her portrait practice, based in her studio at 141 Bath Street, Glasgow. She produced decorative but unsentimental images of young women and children. Her paintings are characterised by unconventional placing of figures, unusual color schemes, and shadow patterns, as can be seen in this work. This painting becomes increasing stylized towards the bottom of the image, using a limited palette and shadows to dramatic effect.
We present today's painting thanks to National Galleries of Scotland. :))
