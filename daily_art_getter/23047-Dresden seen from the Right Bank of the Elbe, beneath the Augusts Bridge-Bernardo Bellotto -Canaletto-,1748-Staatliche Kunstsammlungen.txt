The image of the city of Dresden has been recorded for centuries in paintings, prints, photos, as well as on coins and porcelain. It has been reproduced on postcards, coffee pods, wall plates, and medals. No other painting has shaped our image of Dresden until the present more than this veduta (view), which measures 1.33 x 2.37 meters (4.4 x 7.8 feet) and which was created by the Venetian painter Bernardo Bellotto (1722â€“1780), called Canaletto. Bernardo Bellotto created the painting in 1748. It was his second work in the capital. After he arrived in Dresden in 1747 on the invitation of August III, he was appointed court artist in 1748 by the Elector of Saxony and King of Poland.
We present today's painting thanks to the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden.
P.S. Canaletto painted several views of his hometown of Venice but also depicted London. You can see this painting here among other beautiful London vedutas.
