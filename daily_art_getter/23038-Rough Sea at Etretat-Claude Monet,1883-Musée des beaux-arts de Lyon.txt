The painting depicts a stormy sea on a winter day. The cliff in the background is at Étretat (Seine Maritime); Monet frequently stayed in the area during the winter of 1864–65, and wrote: "I spend my time outdoors on the stone when it's big time [...] and of course I work all the time." Monet composed the painting in February 1883 from his hotel window. 
In the foreground, two fishermen stand beside their boat; three caloges (old, overturned boat hulls used for storage) occupy the narrow space available to beaching boats. The picturesque shape of the cliff stands out against the curtain of rain that streaks the sky in the distance, the horizontal brush strokes emphasizing the strata of the rock. Buffeted by violent winds, the pearly waves—depicted in rapid, vibrant curls—fill the central part of the picture. 
Have a great Saturday!
