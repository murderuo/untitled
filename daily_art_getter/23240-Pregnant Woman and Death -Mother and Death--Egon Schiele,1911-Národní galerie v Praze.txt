Egon Schiele’s tragic childhood experience (the death of his brothers and a sister) is reflected in his art. The topic of death first appeared in the artist’s work in 1910, namely in Dead Mother (from the Leopold Museum in Vienna—check our archive to see it); the same topic is also crucial for the Prague painting. The two pieces of art are painted in ochre and brown hues. Pregnant Woman and Death, however, is composed more of geometric and intertwining diagonal lines. It is interesting that Death, partly bearing Schiele’s features, including the hairstyle and clothing, gives an impression of a monk.
We present today's painting thanks to the National Gallery in Prague.  : )
P.S. Here you can visit seven haunting towns in Egon Schiele's paintings!
