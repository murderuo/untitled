A couple of years ago I was interning at the Capitoline Museum in Rome. Since then, the Eternal City is one of my favorite cities in the world. When I saw this painting I just couldn't resist and I had to feature it in DailyArt :)
Caspar van Wittel was one of the Northern European painters working in Rome in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. This view of the Piazza Navona gives particular prominence to three architectural projects involved in the remodelling of the square by Pope Innocent X: on the left, the reconstruction of the Pamphili family palace and the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone, completed by Borromini; and in the center of the composition, facing the church, Bernini's Four Rivers fountain. Van Wittel created visual descriptions of the modern cityâ€”a historical postcard from Rome.
