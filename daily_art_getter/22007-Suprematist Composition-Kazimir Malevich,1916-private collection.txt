Suprematist Composition, which Malevich completed the same year he wrote his Suprematist Manifesto, is renowned throughout the world as a premier painting from one of the most sophisticated and innovative artistic movements of the twentieth century. This painting was sold at a Sotheby's auction for $60 million to an anonymous buyer and it is the most expensive work in the history of Russian art.Malevich was a devout Christian mystic who believed the central task of an artist was that of rendering spiritual feeling. According to the artist's beliefs, visual depiction of objects shouldn't be important for 20th century, modern artists. All that counted was: basic geometric forms, such as circles, squares, lines, and rectangles, painted in a limited range of colors. Suprematism was suppose to be an universal art that was immediately accessible, unmistakably clear and "supreme" in its aesthetic intentions.Help us and donate so we will be able to release the new version of DailyArt this autumn: http://support.getdailyart.com
