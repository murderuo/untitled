Allegory of Sculpture is a watercolor painting that represents the symbolism of Gustav Klimt’s early work. In the center is the naked personification of sculpture, adorned with hair ornaments that appear Hellenistic, a snake bracelet, earrings, and a delicate golden necklace. In her left hand she holds a Victory goddess with a laurel wreath, balancing on a globe. The background of the picture features common sculptural motifs from antiquity, such as the Boy with Thorn, Athena Parthenos, and Juno Ludovisi. In 1897, Martin Gerlach’s Allegorien. Neue Folge [Allegories. New series] was published in which Klimt again refers to the theme of allegorical depiction of sculpture but strongly breaks up the antique-like depiction.
