We present today's painting thanks to Skagens Kunstmuseer - one of the museums I really dream to visit one day. Check their awesome collection in our archives! :)
Anna Ancher painted her own studio in the house on Markvej in Skagen in this picture, but it looks more like a living room because there are no indications in the painting that this is an artistâ€™s working space. There is no easel, no paintbrushes, and most importantly, no paintings. Instead, she has chosen to focus on the table and the beautiful bouquet of clematis flowers on the table, and the window framed by the light blue curtains. In 1913, the architect Ulrik Plesner designed an extension of their home with studios for both artists. Anna Ancher probably painted this picture shortly after the completion of the extension. The picture gets its title from the clematis in the vase on the table. The clematis is of the Jackmanii variety, which still grows in the gardens of the art museums in Skagen.
