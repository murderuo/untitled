Today is Sunday, so this month you can count on another masterpiece from the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam :) We hope you will like it! :) 
Ernst Ludwig Kirchner is one of the founders of Die Brücke (The Bridge), a group of German expressionist artists. Kirchner was a great admirer of Henri Matisse and Vincent van Gogh, and also of primitive art. Tanzende closely resembles a figure of a Bangwa queen acquired just before 1900 by the Museum für Völkerkunde in Berlin. The dancing woman is one of his earliest sculptures. She is carved from alder, her shape determined by the tree trunk, which Kirchner first worked with an axe, and then a knife. To make the sculpture even more expressive, he decided to paint the rough surface. The shape, color, and movement combine to suggest that Tanzende has just stepped out of one of Kirchner’s paintings and assumed three-dimensional form.In the Stedelijk Museum, you will find also a very fine contemporary art collection. Here's a selection of a few coolest works!
Dear users: we have a dream to translate DailyArt to new languages: Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Turkish and Italian. To make that happen we need to update the app and build  some new software infrastructure. We need $10,000 - if you would like to help us you can donate here :) Thank you <3
