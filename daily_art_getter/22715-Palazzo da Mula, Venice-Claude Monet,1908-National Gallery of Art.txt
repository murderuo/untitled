Oscar-Claude Monet was a French painter, a founder of French Impressionist painting, and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to plein air landscape painting.The term "Impressionism" is derived from the title of his painting Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris.
And guess what - today is his birthday! 
The canvases Monet painted during his sole voyage to Venice in the fall of 1908 are among the most popular and the best known of his artworks. "Although I am enthusiastic about Venice, and though I've started a few canvases, I'm afraid I will only bring back beginnings that will be nothing else but souvenirs for me," Monet wrote to the art seller Gaston Bernheim. But once he saw the city, Monet was "gripped by Venice." After several days looking for locations, he felt an urge to paint. In today's painting we see a Palazzo on Murano Island.
