Maybe it's too late to get a Christmas gift online, but we have some DailyArt paper calendars that you may like and they will be useful from January 1st on so ... you can check them out here!  : )
Some of you may know that recently I've became obsessed with Monet's Haystacks. It's difficult for me to explain, but they give me a sense of calmness and pure natural beauty. Did you know that Monet created some 30 paintings with this subject between 1890 and 1891 near his house at Giverny? In the midst of this effort, he wrote to the critic Gustave Geoffroy: "I am working very hard, struggling with a series of different effects (haystacks), but at this season the sun sets so fast I cannot follow it. The more I continue, the more I see that a great deal of work is necessary in order to succeed in rendering what I seek." 
The haystacks are about everything that Impressionism was about—light, change, and capturing the moment. See you tomorrow and hope you're not too tired before Christmas. (I am! :D)
Cheers!
