This is the only time that Rembrandt painted such a typically Dutch landscape. A striking element is the contrast between the dark clouds and the bright rays of sunlight glancing off the bridge and the trees. Rembrandt emphasized this effect by giving the darker portions of the composition only a thin layer of paint, while the lighter sections are thickly painted.
