Madonna Enthroned is also known as the Ognissanti Madonna. It has a traditional Christian subject, representing the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child seated on her lap, with saints and angels surrounding them on all sides. This particular representation of the Virgin is called a Maestà, a popular representation at the time. The painting was created by Giotto di Bondone in 1310 - it's important because It is often celebrated as the first painting of the Renaissance due to its newfound naturalism and escape from the constraints of Gothic art. Still, I think it is better to call it be "proto-Renaissance". Before Giotto, painting was still tied to the schematic Byzantine style and its archaisms. The figures were often stiff, two-dimensional and did not evoke emotional involvement with the viewer. Giotto broke with that tradition revolutionizing painting and the representation of the human figure. Without Giotto, the cultural, philosophical and artistic movement we all call the Renaissance would never have been born.It was originally painted for the Ognissanti Franciscan church in Florence. Built for the Humiliati, a small religious order at the time, the church had many acclaimed paintings designed for it. Specifically, Giotto's Madonna Enthroned was designed for the high altar.Today is the birthday of Henri, little brother from one of our users Zoe from China. Happy Birthday Henri :)
