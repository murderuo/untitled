Today we continue our monthly feature and we present another magnificent artwork from National Galleries of Scotlandâ€”enjoy!
Three three-quarter length figures stand out against a vivid, colorful background. Two women flank a young man, seen from behind. They may be offering him a choice, possibly between vice, symbolised by the apple, and virtue, symbolised by the flowers. This suggestion ties in with the allegorical character of many of Gauguin's Tahitian paintings in which ideas from different cultures are fused together. Gauguin used the same two young women as models in other paintings made around the same time, during his second period in Tahiti from 1895 to 1901.
