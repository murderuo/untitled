Hendrick Avercamp was a Dutch painter. As one of the first landscape painters of the 17th-century Dutch school, he specialized in painting the Netherlands in winter—his work gaining international renown. Avercamp's paintings are colorful and lively, with carefully crafted images of the people in the landscape. Many of his paintings feature people ice skating on frozen lakes.Avercamp's work enjoyed great popularity and he sold his drawings, many of which were tinted with water-color as finished pictures to be pasted into the albums of collectors.Avercamp probably painted in his studio on the basis of sketches he had made in the winter. . The passion for painting skating characters probably came from his childhood, during which he enjoyed skating with his parents. The last quarter of the 16th century, during which Avercamp was born, was one of the coldest periods of the Little Ice Age.Help us and donate so we will be able to release the new version of DailyArt: http://support.getdailyart.com
