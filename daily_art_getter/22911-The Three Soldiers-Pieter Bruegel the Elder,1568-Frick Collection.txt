Pieter Bruegel the Elder is best known for his large landscapes and town views populated by small, lively figures (often contemporary peasants), illustrating biblical, allegorical, and folkloric subjects. In addition to the Frick example, only two other grisaille paintings by Bruegel are known, both on religious themes. This little panel, once in the collection of Charles I of England, represents a trio of Landsknechte, the mercenary foot soldiers whose picturesque costumes and swashbuckling airs provided popular images for printmakers in the 16th century. Bruegel may have executed the Frick grisaille as a model for such an engraving, although none is known, or simply as a cabinet piece. The attenuated grace of the figures in this painting may reflect currents in contemporary Italian art.
We present today's painting thanks to the Frick Collection.
P.S. One of my favorite Bruegel paintings is The Harvestersâ€”you can learn more about it here.
