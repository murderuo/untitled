Crown Prince Sawant Singh was the ruler of the princely state of Kishangarh in 18th Century India. He is rightly credited for the remarkable artistic achievement of the great court painter, Nihal Chand.
While Nihal Chand and other Kishangarh painters drew inspiration from their counterparts in the neighboring Mughal kingdom, there are obvious differences in subjects, dress designs, architectural details, and landscape patterns of their paintings. Moreover, an overarching Hindu theme and religious fervor is apparent in the Kishangarh works.
The Crown Prince (also a talented artist) drew a rough sketch of his paramour Vishnupriya for Nihal Chand to paint. Vishnupriya was a glamorous woman and was well known for her beauty and style. She was referred to as "Bani Thani", which loosely translated means "she who is all dressed up".
Nihal Chand envisioned Vishnupriya as Radha, the divine consort of the Hindu God Krishna. She is illustrated in the classic Kishangarh style with sharp and elongated features. The henna on her palms, the painted fingernails, the sheer odhani (a traditional covering garment), and the opulent jewelry of gold and pearls form the quintessential image of feminine beauty.
This painting became the very symbol of Kishangarh miniatures and was even featured on a commemorative postage stamp issued by the Indian Government in 1973.
