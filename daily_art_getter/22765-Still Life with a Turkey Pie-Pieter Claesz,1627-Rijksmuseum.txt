Even in unexpected objects, the presence of Asia is implicitâ€”for instance in savory pies that contain ingredients such as cinnamon, mace, cloves, and ginger. The gleaming wine jug is a masterpiece of reflection. In the body of the jug we see not only a window and part of the laid table, but also the shadowy figure of the painter behind his easel.
