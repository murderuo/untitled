In 1540, the Duke of Florence, Cosimo de Medici, commissioned an artwork as a gift for King Francis I of France. The work was made by his court painter, Agnolo Bronzino (1503-1572), and became the masterpiece of this artist. An Allegory with Venus and Cupid is a beautiful painting, rich in symbolism. Venus, goddess of love and beauty, occupies the center of the image. She's nude, and holds an apple (Paris gave the apple to her in a beauty contest). Her son, Cupid, god of love, touches her breast as he prepares to kiss her. Note, however, that she is taking away his arrow. At right, the scene is occupied by Pleasure, the nude child with roses; behind him, is Deceit, a creature with a girl's head and beast's body, that offers a honeycomb to Venus. Above them, a man, Time, stops Oblivion, who tries to cover the scene with a veil. Behind Cupid, is a screaming figure identified as Jealousy, or perhaps, the effects of syphilis, a disease that took on epidemic proportions in the 16th century. It is a great painting, in which classic and erotic elements add to the virtuosity of the mannerist painter.
