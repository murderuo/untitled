The exhibition ends on September 9th, so if you're nearby don't miss it! :)
Anton Cepka (b. 1936) is among the most important makers of world art of the latter half of the 20th century. Regarded to be the founder of Czech and Slovak artistic jewellery, Cepka was a member of Czech-Slovak group of Klub konkretistov (Club of Concretists, founded in Prague in 1967)—artists who preferred the geometrically-constructive abstraction approach. In addition to jewelry, he dedicated himself to sculptural and designed constructive-kinetic implementations, whether cabinet or monumental, as well as objects intended for various indoor/outdoor architectural areas. In 1990, Cepka founded a studio of jewelry at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Bratislava and serve as its head for several years. His production won multiple awards at international exhibitions. His jewelry production chiefly features brooches; for materials, he particularly favors silver.
