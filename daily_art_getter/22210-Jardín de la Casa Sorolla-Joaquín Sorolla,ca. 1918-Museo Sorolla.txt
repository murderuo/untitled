We present today's painting thanks to Museo Sorolla, one of the most beautiful museums in Madrid :) Enjoy!
So intense was Sorolla’s fascination with the gardens of the Alcázar in Seville and the Alhambra in Granada that he used them as the model for the one he designed between 1910 and 1917 for his new house and studio in Madrid. The two Andalusian gardens, which he regularly visited and painted during the final phase of his career, would be his principal source of inspiration for combining the elements of light, water, and color, ordering them through the architecture.
Conceived and designed with the eye of a painter, the garden of the Sorolla House became the artist’s favourite subject for his final works. Some of Sorolla’s depictions of his garden show views of its different areas. Others focus on the effects of light or on the attractive colors of a flowerbed, a flowering shrub, or a single flowerpot that catches our eye in a hidden corner or on the edge of the fountain. In numerous other oils the columns and statues create interesting compositions and play of perspective that alter our perception at each step, enriching the experience by gradually revealing the space, as if the garden unfolded itself little by little before our eyes.
