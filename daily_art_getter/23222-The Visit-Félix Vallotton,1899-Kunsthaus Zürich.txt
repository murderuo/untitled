Félix Vallotton is one of my favorite painters ever. I have always been intrigued by his strangeness, wit, weird color, and his odd position outside the mainstream artistic currents of his time. Although Vallotton has always been admired in his native Switzerland (the majority of his works remain in Swiss museums and private collections), he has received scant recognition elsewhere. 
He was a master of narrative suspense, his series of interior scenes from 1897–1899 offers a voyeuristic lens onto private worlds of forbidden love and heartbreak—ambiguous scenarios that find echoes in the work of Edward Hopper. That cinematic quality, which was undoubtedly influenced by Vallotton’s interest in theater, could even have found its way into the films of Alfred Hitchcock, while his unique color palette is comparable to the film sets of Wes Anderson. 
And you know, he was born on this day in 1865.  : )
P.S. Here you can read about another Vallotton painting: The Lie.
