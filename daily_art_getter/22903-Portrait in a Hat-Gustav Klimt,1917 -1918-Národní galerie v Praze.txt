Gustav Klimt established new parametres in art by projecting the innermost feelings and states of mind into his paintings that are elegantly stylized and have an ubiquitous erotic charge. The provocative hedonist Klimt received commissions to portray ladies from Vienna’s high society. These portraits earned him immense popularity and gave him a certain independence. His figural portraits of wealthy women and models were preceded by a great many preparatory drawings. They are the most private part of his artwork and were not intended for public exhibition. In a rapid, expressive drawing, he depicted his models in what were frequently very erotic positions. Made in the final years of Klimt’s life is also this sophisticated Viennese woman shown in Portrait in a Hat, now in the National Gallery in Prague. The figure has the typical characteristics of his models: a frontal, self-assured look with slightly closed lids and a strong, round chin. The drawing, done with relaxed, confident lines, is the work of a true master of draftsmanship.
We present today's painting thanks to the Národní galerie Praha in Prague. :) I love it!
