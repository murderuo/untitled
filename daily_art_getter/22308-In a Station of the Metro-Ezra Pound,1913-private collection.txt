This week will be special.
Tomorrow is our 5th birthday. Yes, exactly 5 years ago we launched DailyArt. I would never believe we would grow this much and live this long! I will give more official and boring statements tomorrow, but you should know now that we have prepared something extra for our anniversary :) We want to share with you five pieces of art chosen by the people who work for DailyArt on a daily basis.
We start with Staszek, who is our designer and one of my best friends. Without Staszek I probably wouldn't have survived some super difficult times that happened during the five years of DailyArt existence. As Staszek studied English Studies he wants to show to you not a regular painting, but an Ezra Pound's poem. Enjoy, see you tomorrow, and under this link you can read a bit more about us and our birthday. :)

Although not literally a painting, Poundâ€™s poem gave a foundation to Vorticism, an avant-garde movement in British art that aimed at disturbing the ingrained rules of the Victorian era.
It combines features I value most in art in general: syncretic and somnambulic imagery, peculiar rhythm and structure, and the use of whitespace.
Ezra Pound described it as follows:
"In a poem of this sort one is trying to record the precise instant when a thing outward and objective transforms itself, or darts into a thing inward and subjective. [...]I realized quite vividly that if I were a painter, or if I had, often, that kind of emotion, or even if I had the energy to get paints and brushes and keep at it, I might [have] found a new school of painting, of "non-representative" painting, a painting that would speak only by arrangements in colour."
