Manuel I was King of Portugal from 1495 to 1521, a period during which Portugal led Europe in voyages of exploration. The architecture and decorative arts of his reign are characterised by a style known as Manueline, which is dense in eclectic ornamental texture.‘Manueline’ combine elements from the Gothic and Italian Renaissance styles as well as Flemish art, with elements from Portugal’s Islamic heritage, and from other lands which were being newly explored. There is nothing in the art or architecture of any other European country, at any period, that is at the same time so flamboyant, richly detailed and exotic.This bizarre and monumental ewer would have had an accompanying basin enabling it to be used for hand-washing at the table. It has decoration on every possible surface; monstrous figures, acrobats, scaly legs with claws, a queen with attendants, musicians, horsemen in combat, frolicking fish-tailed centaurs.We present today's masterpiece thanks to the cooperation with Ashmolean Museum. The ewer formed part of the spectacular Wellby bequest to the Ashmolean Museum, consisting of some 500 precious and exotic objects from the Gothic to the Rococo.
