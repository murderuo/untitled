In her short life of only 31 years, Paula Modersohn-Becker not only produced an extensive oeuvre of over 750 paintings and 1000 drawings, but also achieved a mode of artistic expression that made her a pioneer of modernism. The enigmatic painting, Girl with Flower Garland, which depicts the artist’s younger sister Herma, was acquired by the Nationalgalerie Berlin for the exhibition of modern art at the Crown Prince’s Palace. With this purchase, as well as with the founding a year earlier of the first museum in the world devoted to a woman painter, Modersohn-Becker received the recognition and visibility that eluded her during her lifetime.
We present today's painting thanks to the Nationalgalerie Berlin, where until 8 March 2020 you can visit the Fighting for Visibility: Women Artists in the Nationalgalerie before 1919 exhibition.  If you would like to see more women artists but you can't go to Berlin, get ready for March when we will have a flood of women artists in both the DailyArt app and in the DailyArt Magazine. Why? Because we can! We can never have enough art created by women. So many of these artists were forgotten by art history! We want to change this situation.  : )
