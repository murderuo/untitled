We present today's painting thanks to the New Orleans Museum of Art. :)
"I want to see you in your proper place," wrote Maria Theresa, Empress of the Holy Roman Empire and Archduchess of Austria, to her daughter, Marie Antoinette. Politically astute, the Hapsburg Empress was anxious to see her daughter formally portrayed as Queen of France, but few artists met her rigid standards. The exception was Vigée Le Brun. The daughter of a portraitist and wife of a prominent art dealer, she initially painted informal portraits of the Queen and her children. Given the opportunity to paint state portraits, Vigée Le Brun astutely endowed Marie Antoinette with the formal dignity and regal hauteur that would appeal to her imperial parent. Clad in royal blue, her rectitude emphasized by a pillar, the Queen sits at a table that holds her crown. The book in her hands is stamped with the Bourbon and Habsburg coat-of-arms, symbolizing the union cemented by her marriage to Louis XVI. This magnificent state portrait pleased both the Empress and the Queen. Vigée Le Brun was awarded membership in the Académie Royale and continuing royal patronage.

Don't forget that March is Women's History Month! On this occasion, we try to feature a lot of female artists. :)
