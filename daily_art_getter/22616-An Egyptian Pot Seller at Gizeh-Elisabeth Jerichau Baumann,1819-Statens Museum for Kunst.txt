This is our third Sunday with Statens Museum for Kunst's collection. :) Enjoy!
One of Jerichau Baumann’s major works, this canvas distils observations made on travels in Turkey, Greece, and Egypt in 1869–1870 and 1874–1875. Its sensuousness and bold colors are atypical of Danish art from the period, yet it has less of the pointed ethnocentrism that characterised international Orientalism at the time. The scene is rich in color and contrast; the glorious hues of the rug catch the eye. The nude body beneath sheer silk and the exotic jewellery add a sensuous quality that still impresses.
Of Polish-German descent, Jerichau Baumann had a wider outlook than most Danish artists of the time. Alongside Martinus Rørbye, she made the most important Danish contributions to 19th-century European Orientalism. The painting’s most recent owner, Birgit Pouplier, wrote books on Elisabeth Jerichau Baumann that proved instrumental for the artist’s recent revival.
Dear all, as we have promised - we want to start translating DailyArt to other languagues. If English is not your first language, we would love to know your opinion about with which languages we should start! Here is our quick survey. Thank you for your help! :))
