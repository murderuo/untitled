Today it's All Souls' Day, a Christian festival that commemorates the faithful departed, which is why we decided to show this painting of the cemetery created by Amrita Sher-Gil today. The art of this Indian modern artist shows not surprisingly a blend of European and Indian elements. Her command over handling of oil medium and use of color, as well as her vigorous brushwork and strong feeling for composition, all go towards giving a dazzling quality to her genius. Sher-Gil's art education was completed in Paris where she was influenced by the artists like Gauguin. While her childhood years were spent travelling between India and Europe, she returned to India in the mid 30s to make India her home. 
In 1941, at age 28, just days before the opening of her first major solo show in Lahore, she became seriously ill and slipped into a coma. She later died around midnight on 5 December 1941, leaving behind a large volume of work. The reason for her death has never been ascertained. A failed abortion and subsequent peritonitis have been suggested as possible causes for her death.
P.S. Dia de los Meurtos is celebrated today across Mexico. It is a glorious celebration of life and a time to remember and honor the dead. Calacas and calaveras (skeletons and skulls) appear everywhere. Skull imagery is, of course, popular across many cultures, let's review skulls in art here!
