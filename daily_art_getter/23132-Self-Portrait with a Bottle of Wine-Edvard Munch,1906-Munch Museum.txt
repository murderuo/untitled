On this day in 1863, Edvard Munch, creator of The Scream, which has become one of the most iconic images of world art, was born. 
By the early 1900s Munch had become a recognized artist. But for him personally, these were difficult years, marked by alcoholism, angst, and unease. Between 1904 and 1907 he painted several self-portraits with loneliness as a theme. Self-Portrait with a Bottle of Wine was painted in Weimar in 1906. The artist sits at the table, alone with a bottle of wine, a glass, and a plate. The hunched figure and the weak folded hands are an expression of utter helplessness. Two figures resembling waiters are standing back-to-back in the background. They are pictured as have a shared body, and almost seem top have grown out of Munch’s own body. The two heads, each looking in different directions, can be interpreted as metaphors for opposing forces in the artist’s soul. This split into two states of mind can be found in some other Munch pictures.
P.S. If you miss summer, you must see this stunning selection of Munch's summer night paintings. <3
