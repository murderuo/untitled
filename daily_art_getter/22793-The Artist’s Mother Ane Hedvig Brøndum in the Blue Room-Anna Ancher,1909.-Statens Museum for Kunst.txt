Thematically, Anna Ancher’s paintings were influenced by an intimate connection to the local communities and a lifelong connection to the light and geography of Skagen.   Maybe because of this isolation from the capital and the dominating intellectual currents in the Academy, Anna Ancher became one of the many artists in Skagen who, with her unique take on Impressionism, managed to pave the way for a whole new modern painting. Together with her husband Michael Ancher, she single handedly created a modernist breakthrough for the painting that interpreted crucial new tendencies in modern European painting, taking the local community in which she was raised as a point of departure.
