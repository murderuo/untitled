August Macke wrote about Lovis Corinth's works: "The brush is his sword, the palette his shield; painting is his weapon." Together with other important representatives of German Impressionism, such as Max Liebermann and Max Slevogt, Corinth was loudly against the stiffened rules and standards of the Art Academies sponsored by Kaiser Wilhelm II at the beginning of the 20th century. These progressive artists demanded a free use of colors and forms in order to express their subjective perception of the world. Corinth provoked not only with his style of painting, but also with his portrayals of death and sexuality. His late works, such as this still-life, are characterized by a strong application of color and an irrepressible manner of painting. Most of the Corinth's late work was confiscated by the Nazis in 1930s and removed from the museums. Autumn Flowers was an exception; it wasnâ€™t destroyed but could not be exhibited. It survived.
Have a great weekend!
