For the next four weeks every Sunday we will present masterpieces created by two great artists - the sculptor French Auguste Rodin and the Polish artist Xavery Dunikowski. All of them depict women. To find more about this great exhibition, visit the website of the National Museum in Krakow (link below). Enjoy! :)
The sculpture is a figure from the tympanum Gates of Hell, one of the most famous and largest works by Rodin, which the artist worked on for 37 years and never finished. It is this sculptural group work that such famous works as The Thinker and The Kiss come from. The Crouching Woman indicates an important element of the sculptor's art – the female body, which Rodin found fascinating. Here, the woman assumes a difficult pose, in which scholars see references to the aesthetics of works by Michelangelo. Rodin liked the dynamics of the body, its muscle tone, expression. He used to have nude models walk around his atelier, and whenever something fascinated him, he asked them to freeze in their poses and sketched them. Numerous works by Rodin, which emphasize the female sexuality, exude eroticism and sensuality. The artist highlights the sexual characteristics – breasts, buttocks, wombs, captured during intimate situations. It is particularly evident in his drawings, several of which can be viewed at the exhibition.
