Happy birthday to Edgar Degas, who was born on this day in 1834! :)
Degas’s oeuvre is full of images of women grooming themselves. In the absence of a male audience, implied or seen, his nudes are unselfconscious in stance and gesture. Degas loved the awkward poses captured by snapshots, and these informed his vision of the private world of women. In After the Bath, a woman steps out of her tub and toward a maid with waiting towel. Balancing on her left leg, the bather stabilizes herself by placing her left arm on a chair as she steps out of the bath. The intimacy of the scene is accentuated by its composition, the simple setting—a tub, a couple of chairs, a screen, and some fabrics—sumptuously rendered in orange, pink, and gold set off by intense blues, surrounding the figure like the entrance to a grotto.
We present today's painting thanks to The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. <3Degas was a famous painter but hardly anyone knows he was also an art collector. You can find out more about it here.
Dear users: we have a dream to translate DailyArt to new languages: Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Turkish and Italian. To make that happen we need to update the app and build  some new software infrastructure. We need $10,000 - if you would like to help us you can donate here :) Thank you <3
