Beginning in the 1630s, van Goyen created panoramic views of Dutch cities. His view of Dordrecht seen from the south across the Oude Maas (Old Meuse River) with the silhouette of the Gothic Grote Kerk has the qualities of a marine landscape. Using relaxed brushwork and in some cases very thin paint, van Goyen captures the translucence and motion of air and water. His largely brown coloration with frugal use of shades of blue and green makes the humidity of the scene almost tangible.
We present today's painting thanks to Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna :)Here you can read a story about another Dutch landscape - the famous Vermeer's View of Delft!
