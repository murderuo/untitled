We present today's painting thanks to our favorite Mauritshuis, which recently acquired a flower cartouche painted in 1644 by the Flemish artist Daniel Seghers (1590–1661). A portrait bust of the poet, diplomat, and scholar, Constantijn Huygens (1596–1687), former neighbour of the Mauritshuis, is in the center of the composition. The painting had long been off the radar, but it resurfaced recently in a private collection. After a thorough restoration the painting is now installed in the museum. It is a dream acquisition—for many reasons.
The Jesuit Daniel Seghers was a flower painter in Antwerp. He specialized in flower still lifes, known as flower cartouches, surrounding a religious scene, a saint, or portrait. The new acquisition, painted on a large copper plate, is a fine example of Seghers’s work. Seghers did not paint the images within his cartouches himself. The grisailles were executed by various Flemish painters. A contemporary poem tells us that the bust of Constantijn Huygens was painted by Jan Cossiers (1600–1671), another Antwerp painter. We do not know whether Huygens posed for Cossiers. He had unmistakable features and the portrait was probably based on one of the many portrait prints of him that were in circulation. It shows a rather older Huygens, identified by his goatee, bulging eyes, and the motto on the plinth: Constanter (steadfast).
See you tomorrow! :)
P.S. Among the Mauritshuis' collection you will find true treasures, like the famous View of Delft by Johannes Vermeer. You can read about it here.
