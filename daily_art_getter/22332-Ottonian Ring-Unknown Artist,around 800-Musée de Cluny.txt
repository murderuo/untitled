We present today's unique piece—an Ottonian ring thanks to Musée de Cluny, where until January 8th you can visit the Glass, The Inventive Middle Ages exhibition. We rarely feature such objects, so I hope you'll like it!
The ring joined the collections of the Musée de Cluny in 2009. It is one of the rare examples of cloisonné enamel of the Ottonian or Salian period. It is composed of a circular bezel set with an enamelled disk, shank, and little spheres placed on the shank and shoulders’ circumference. The shank is filigreed and adorned with triangular motifs.
The analysis suggests that the ring was made of elements used before as different artifacts. The enamel might have been a small circular medallion used in a gold religious artwork.
