I can't believe it's December already. Time flies!
And this December will be very difficult for us as we hope to release the long awaited language versions. Soon this month DailyArt will be available in Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, and Turkish! But hush for now. We will inform you about the details soon. Please keep your fingers crossed. :)

The work at the very heart of the Albertina (thank you for letting us publish it today!), Dürer’s famous Hare, can be shown only every few years. Duke Albert of Saxe-Teschen received it in 1796 as part of an exchange of artworks with Emperor Francis II. Hare is still regarded as one of the most important artworks of the collection on account of its extraordinarily realistic depiction. Remarkable, too, that the provenance of the drawing can be followed back without interruption to Dürer’s workshop, the windows of which can be seen upon closer examination reflected in the eyes of the depicted hare.
P.S. Here's 7 images of Dürer’s animals that are better than a trip to the zoo!
