Yesterday I came back from a short trip to Venice, and I discovered there a lot of paintings created by Lorenzo Lotto. Lotto was one of the leading Venetian-trained painters of the earlier 16th century. His early works are strongly influenced by Giovanni Bellini. Lotto was active in various places in Italy and absorbed a wide range of other influences, from Lombard realism to Raphael. He was deeply religious and his late paintings become intensely spiritual. Unable to compete with Titian, Lotto often worked outside Venice. His works are characterised by the use of deeply saturated colours, bold use of shadow, and a surprising expressive range, from the nearly caricatural to the lyrical. He is one of the most individualistic of the great Italian painters.The woman on this portrait has not been conclusively identified. Dressed in an elaborate and softly painted costume of gleaming green and orange, she directs attention to a drawing held in her left hand. This shows her Roman namesake, Lucretia, about to stab herself after she had been raped by the son of King Tarquin.The transparency of the paint reveals that Lotto originally depicted Lucretia in colour, not as a monochrome drawing. The portrait, while displaying the beauty of the sitter, also proclaims her virtue. The message is underlined by the Latin inscription on the paper on the table, taken from the Roman historian Livy: 'After Lucretia's example let no violated woman live'.See you tomorrow!ZuzannaHelp us and donate so we will be able to release the new version of DailyArt this autumn: http://support.getdailyart.com
