If you ever wondered who is standing behind the code at DailyArt - it's Piotrek and PaweL. The boys are iOS and Android developers and they are creating the apps we are using. Big ups for them - they put all their hearts into our software development :)
Because it's our anniversary week (since Tuesday DailyArt is 5 years old!) Piotrek and PaweL chose a piece of art they would like to present to you. As both of them are Sci-fi fans, they chose a Futurism classic - Boccioni's Unique Forms of Continuity in Space.
PS. Today our iMessage stickers are available free. You can download them to your iOS device here :)
The futurist movement was founded by writers and artists like Umberto Boccioni, who enthused about new inventions such as cars and electricity. In Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, the figure is aerodynamically deformed by speed. The sculpture may reflect ideas of the mechanised body that appeared in futurist writings, as well as the ‘superman’ envisaged by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Boccioni's goal for the work was to depict a "synthetic continuity" of motion instead of an "analytical discontinuity". It looks very futuristic, doesn't it? And keep in mind it was created in 1913!
