It's Sunday so it's time for our monthly special feature - this time of the collection of the National Museum of Women in the Arts. It means we will be presenting contemporary art created by women artists. We hope you will like it!
Alma Woodsey Thomas developed her painting style, characterized by tiled, rhythmic brushstrokes known as Alma Stripes, in the mid-to-late 1960s. Her technique was influenced by the Washington Color School, a D.C.-based art movement that focused on color as subject. Throughout her career, Thomas found inspiration in phenomena related to the natural world: seasons, flowers, and space exploration.
In the late 1960s, Thomas began her Space Paintings series, inspired by NASAâ€™s space program and its photographic and televised images. Indicative of her later works, Thomas shifts toward a monochromatic palette of rich crimsons. This painting imagines the power of gravity through a personalized and expressive palette, rather than a literal depiction of the cosmos.
