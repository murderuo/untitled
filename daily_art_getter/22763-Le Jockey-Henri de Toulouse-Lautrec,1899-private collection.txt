This was one of Toulouse-Lautrec's last lithographs. The publisher Pierrefort intended to issue a portfolio with a racing theme, but Toulouse-Lautrec (1864â€“1901) was suffering acute alcoholic collapse at this time and this was the only print of the set that was completed. Three further works from the proposed series survive, but only one of these approaches a finished state. The Jockey was issued in two editions, first as a monochrome lithograph, and secondly in a color version with the addition of five new color stones. The print expresses the power and pace of the racehorses, rather than the jockeys who are shown from behind with a total lack of expressive detail. Toulouse-Lautrec's facility as a draftsman is clear, as is his ability to distort and exaggerate in order to create atmosphere and character, by excessive foreshortening of the horses' necks in this lithograph.
Another famous lithograph created by Toulouse-Lautrec is Divan Japonais depicting celebrities from the Montmartre - you can watch it here.
