Wassily Kandinsky's, can be often perceived as highly contrasting in color and very chaotic. Kandinsky championed a mystical approach to art. His treatise Concerning the Spiritual in Art, published in 1911, argued for art that was purified from all references to the material world. He felt that colour in particular was essential for liberating art from naturalistic appearances. The title of Swinging conveys the painting’s sense of dynamic movement, suggestive of the rhythms of modernity. Kandinsky was fascinated by the meaning of color and the ways that it could convey messages. As a result, you can see how he uses contrasts between both very light colors and darker ones, including black. The composition of this piece seems to be almost non-existent at first glance judging solely on the chaos of it all, but if you take a closer look, there are actually many horizontals and verticals that do give it balance and structure.
