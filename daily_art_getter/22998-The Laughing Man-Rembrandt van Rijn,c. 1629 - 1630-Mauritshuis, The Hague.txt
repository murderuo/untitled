Eyes shining and eyebrows raised, a man is baring his crooked teeth in a hearty laugh. This is not a portrait, but a character study or tronie of a laughing man. Rembrandt painted it while he was living in Leiden and still had a very smooth style. So it is remarkable that he painted this head with incredibly loose brushstrokesâ€”the style for which he later became famous. In some places, Rembrandt scratched in the wet paint to reveal the base, a copper plate covered in gold leaf.
We present today's painting thanks to Mauritshuis in the Hague, which owns an amazing collection of Rembrandt's works. : )
P.S. Mauritshuis houses one of the most beautiful Vermeers in the world, the View Of Delft. Read about it here!
