Mondrian was particularly known for his investigation of line and color. Using only black lines coupled with grey, white, blue, yellow and red color fields. What distinguishes Mondiran's work here is that color and lines are no do not serve to represent something else but are themselves an image. Mondrian sought a perfect harmony of color in his painting, combined with strictly horizontal and vertical black lines. 
This classic painting can be seen in the Stedelijk Museum, at the exhibition Chagall, Picasso, Mondrian and Others: Migrant Artists in Paris which presents art from the superb collection of the Museum, and includes work by more than 50 artists, photographers, and graphic designers. This is a story of otherness, of what connects us, and of finding our way in a polarised society and art world. Don't miss it if you happen to be  in Amsterdam until February 2nd!
