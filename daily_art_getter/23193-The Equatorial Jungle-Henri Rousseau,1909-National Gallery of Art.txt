I love Rousseau's jungles so much!
Henri Julien Félix Rousseau was ridiculed during much of his lifetime for painting in a naïve or primitive manner. Eventually, however, with the endorsement of Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and other younger artists, he was considered a self-taught genius. His best-known work depicts imaginary jungle scenes inspired by illustrated books and the botanical gardens in Paris, but he also painted smaller scenes of the city and its suburbs. Incredibly, Rousseau never saw a real jungle with his own eyes! 
That's the power of imagination!
P.S. Here's more about these fantastic jungles. <3
