From September 21st in Rembrandt's House in Amsterdam you can visit the exhibition Rembrandt in Paris. It is a little-known fact that in the 19th century Rembrandt was an icon for numerous French avant-garde artists, Impressionists, and Post-Impressionists. Many French artists decided to start etching—as Rembrandt had—and there was a revival of the art form. One of such examples we can see today. :)
Degas captured his models at moments when they appear unaware of scrutiny and are quietly occupied, like this bather as she dries herself while another woman hands her a dressing gown. Rembrandt's raw realism was a great example for Degas. There are no gracious curves here, just dark, angular lines.
