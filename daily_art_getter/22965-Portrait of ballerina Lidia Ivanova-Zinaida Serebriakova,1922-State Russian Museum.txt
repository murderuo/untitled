Today is our last day of this month's partnership with Russian State Museum. Don't forget to look for more pieces from this museum in our Archive!
In the early 20th century, theater played a huge role in art. Russian ballet enjoyed tremendous success all over the world and bright decorative costumes of artists were real works of art. Sketches for them were created by famous artists of that time. The ballet dancer Lidia Ivanova, whose portrait is presented here, was considered a rising star of the Soviet ballet. Her dancing was said to be filled with "dramatic expression." The portrait depicts Lidia Ivanova in the Pas de Trois costume from the ballet Pavilion of Armida staged at the Mariinsky Theatre.
P.S. Many artists painted theater scenes, among them Pierre-Auguste Renoir. You can see his Theatre Box (La Loge) here.
