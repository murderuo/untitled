Well, today Mundial (FIFA World Cup) starts. I hope in the next month you will still find a few minutes to enjoy DailyArt. Some think that we are not as exciting as football (soccer) BUT a little bit of culture also never hurts!
L.S. Lowry was known for his simple depictions of working-class life. Although seen as a mostly solitary and private person, Lowry enjoyed attending matches and was an ardent supporter of Manchester City. The paintingâ€™s large format and panoramic, birds-eye composite view of an imagined landscape perfectly captures the spirit and drama of a town gripped by the excitement of a Saturday match.
And who are you going to cheer for?
