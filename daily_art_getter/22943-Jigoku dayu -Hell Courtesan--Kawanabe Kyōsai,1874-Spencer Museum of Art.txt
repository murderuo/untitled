Using an arm to prop up her head, this woman dreams of numerous skeletons playing, dancing, drinking and frolicking about her. She is not disturbed by these visions, though, because she is the Hell Courtesan, identified by the image of the King of Hell on the lower portion of her costume. Shrouding most of her body is a brilliant red robe that suggests she is impersonating the Buddhist monk Daruma (in Sanskrit, Bodhidharma). Though Daruma is not physically present, it is not uncommon to see satirical images of this holy figure bewitched by a beautiful courtesan. This convention seems to suggest that the Hell Courtesan proves irresistible even to the most holy.
Well, I was stunned when I found this woodcut. Only Japanese culture could produce such an image in the 19th century. Amazing!Â 
Have a great Monday. : )
