Today is the fourth and final Sunday of our special month with Stedelijk Museum from Amsterdam. Please enjoy in the archive what we have already featured from this marvellous collection! :)
The Russian artist Kazimir Malevich, who was obsessed with movement, attempted to capture energy and dynamics on the canvas. Suprematist Composition (with Eight Red Rectangles) was one of his first “objectless” paintings. The red rectangles are not merely flat shapes on a white canvas, but eight bodies with both mass and direction, which the painter captured as they traveled endlessly through space and time. Never before had an artist so radically departed from visual reality and all previous ideas about color, form, and perspective. Malevich regarded abstract, purely pictorial paintings as superior, which is why he called his new style suprematism.
Here you will find everything you must know about Suprematism and Kazimir Malevich.
