Raphael envisaged the figure of a Muse holding the actor’s mask that signifies tragedy: Melpomene infuses the dramatist with searing thoughts and expressive powers. In exploring an ideal of classical beauty and poetic inspiration while drawing, Raphael reflected on the significance of the tragic Muse’s eloquence. Working deftly with the pen, he evoked the dual character of Melpomene as a perfect form and as an evanescent spirit invoked and desired by poets.Raphael’s realisation of Melpomene, discovered through drawing, as an utterly remote but mysteriously frenzied figure was impossible to translate into paint. This drawings stands out in revealing his powers of eloquence in pen and ink.Until September 3rd at The Ashmolean Museum you can see a captivating summer show which brings together 120 stunning works of Raphael from international collections. I would sell my kidney to see it  :O
