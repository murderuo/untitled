Hello, hello in 2020! We hope this New Year will be amazing for you, full of love, good moments, and adventures. : )
We want to welcome you to 2020 with this AMAZING Drinking Bacchus, one of my favorite masterpieces of Western art. As you can see, it presents Bacchus drinking wine and emptying his bladder at the same time—the ultimate symbol of celebration!  : )
Drinking Bacchus, from the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, is also a little clue about our next special monthly feature; the mystery will be solved this Sunday!
Let's talk a little about the painter. Guido Reni was an Italian painter of the Baroque period, although his works showed a classical manner, similar to Simon Vouet, Nicholas Poussin, and Philippe de Champaigne. He was the most famous Italian artist of his generation and painted primarily religious works, but also mythological and allegorical subjects. Active in Rome, Naples, and his native Bologna, he became the dominant figure in the Bolognese School that emerged under the influence of the Carracci.
