Today's painting was requested by one of our users, Anthony. Don't forget that if there is any painting in particular you would like to see in DailyArt we are open to suggestions :)William Merritt Chase was an American painter, known is an exponent of Impressionism and as a teacher. He is also responsible for establishing the Chase School, which later would become Parsons The New School for Design. Like most of his American contemporaries, Chase was eclectic, borrowing with pride and pleasure from many international styles, past and present. Chase's teaching method was rooted in the French Impressionist and in the Barbizon School tradition of painting outdoors in order to take advantage of natural light and changing weather conditions. Between 1891 and 1901, Chase was a highly influential teacher at the Shinnecock Summer Art School in Long Island, New York. This is where he painted "Wind-Swept Sands". As you can see, the rapid brushstrokes and the overall gray tonality indicate an overcast day, while a hint of blue at the horizon suggests the elusive presence of the sun.Help us and donate so we will be able to release the new version of DailyArt this autumn: http://support.getdailyart.com
