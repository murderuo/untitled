Today is our last Sunday of this special month with the Leopold Museum in Vienna. We end it with this beautiful landscape by Gustav Klimt. If you will be in Vienna, don't forget to visit their newly conceived presentation of their marvelous collection in Vienna 1900. Enjoy!  : )
This work impresses with its radical composition, which sees the square of the painting almost entirely used up by the turquoise, slightly undulating surface of the water. Only in the upper-right corner does the shoreline of Litzlberg Island come into view. Contemporary critics, who first saw the work at the 10th Secession Exhibition in 1901, raved about the painting. Among them was Ludwig Hevesi, who expressed his enthusiasm as follows: “A frame full of lake water, of the Attersee, nothing but short gray and green waves, flowing into each other.”
P.S. Here you can see more breathtaking landscapes of Gustav Klimt. <3
P.P.S. Dear users, we are looking for volunteers who could help us with translating DailyArt to Arabic, Japanese and Hindi. If you're interested, here are more details! :)
