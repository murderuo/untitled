I'm sorry for publishing so many female nudes this weekend - I hope it won't be too much for you :)
Today I felt like it would be a perfect day to present something of Toulouse-Lautrec. I don't remember when was the last time when we've showed his work. I found this painting and just couldn't resist. 
Toulouse-Lautrec is well known for his paintings of prostitutes and courtesans. During the 19th-century it was very difficult to not have a stand on women of ill repute. Almost every man was guilty of using their services at one time or another. Lautrec made about fifty paintings of prostitutes, as well as numerous drawings and prints, including a suite of color lithographs, Elles, which was completed the year before this painting.
Look how the artist presents female body. He shows it just as it is. Without any idealization or flattering.
