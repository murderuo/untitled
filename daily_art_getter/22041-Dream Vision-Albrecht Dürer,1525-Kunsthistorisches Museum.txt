“In the year 1525 between Wednesday and Thursday (7-8 June) after Whitsunday during the night I saw this appearance in my sleep, how many great waters fell from heaven. The first struck the earth about four miles away from me with a terrific force, with tremendous clamour and clash, drowning the whole land. I was so sore afraid that I awoke from it before the other waters fell. And the waters which had fallen were very abundant. Some of them fell further away, some nearer, and they came down from such a great height that they all seemed to fall with equal slowness. But when the first water, which hit the earth, was almost approaching, it fell with such swiftness, wind and roaring, that I was so frightened when I awoke that my whole body trembled and for a long while I could not come to myself. So when I arose in the morning I painted above here as I had seen it. God turn all things to the best.”This is a translation of the text from below the weird image we feature today. This watercolor is a visual representation of Albrecht Dürer's nightmare. It is a unique masterpiece—I don't recall anything similar created by a Renaissance or later artist. Now this piece is kept in a volume belonging to the Kunstkammer Vienna (Chamber of Art and Wonders), in Kunsthistorisches Museum. Currently it is on display on the exhibition curated by best-selling author and artist Edmund de Waal "During the night". I definitely have a good reason to visit Vienna now :)Help us and donate so we will be able to release the new version of DailyArt: http://support.getdailyart.com
