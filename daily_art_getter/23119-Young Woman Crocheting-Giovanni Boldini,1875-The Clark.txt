Giovanni Boldini was an Italian genre and portrait painter who lived and worked in Paris for most of his career. According to a 1933 article in Time magazine, he was known as the "Master of Swish" because of his flowing style of painting.
After moving to Paris in 1871, Boldini made many small paintings intended to appeal to collectors. These works often featured his favorite model, Berthe, in leisurely pursuits such as reading, strolling, or, as here, crocheting. The lively brushstrokes record a rich variety of textures, including the vibrantly patterned rug, the ruffled skirt, and the satin shoes.
We present today's painting thanks to The Clark. See you tomorrow!
