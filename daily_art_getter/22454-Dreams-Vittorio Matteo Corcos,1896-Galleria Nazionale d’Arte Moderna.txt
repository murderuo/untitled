Vittorio Matteo Corcos was an Italian painter known for his portraits. Many of his genre works depict winsome and finely dressed young men and women in moments of repose and recreation.
He was born to Jewish parents, Isacco e Giuditta Baquis, in Livorno. He trained at the Academy of Fine Arts of Florence under Enrico Pollastrini. Between 1878 and 1879 he worked under Domenico Morelli in Naples.
He then traveled to Paris where he met LÃ©on Bonnat and signed a contract with Goupil & Cie; he was able to supplement his income as a portrait painter with illustrations for magazines. He frequented the circles of Giuseppe De Nittis. Between 1881 and 1886, he frequently exhibited at the Salon.
The title of today's painting, Dreams, tells everything. The young lady is Elena Vecchi, a friend's daughter. It seems she is looking at us but it's not true. She is dreaming about something (someone?) and we will never find out what about.
See you tomorrow!Zuzanna
