Although George Bellows is best-known for his depictions of urban street views and prize fights that chronicled the elements of power and struggle, he also painted some 140 portraits throughout his career. Among the most successful were his portrayals of family members, especially of his wife Emma and daughters Anne and Jean.
Emma at the Piano of 1914 is often considered the artist's finest portrait of his wife and demonstrates his daring sense of design and sensitivity to color and texture. The strong cobalt blue of Emma's dress contrasts dramatically with her pale face and intense stare, imbuing the work with a bold modernity.
Emma Story was a fellow art student at William Merritt Chase’s school in Manhattan when Bellows first met her. He courted her for five years before she finally consented to marry him in 1910.
Another artist renown for intimate family portraits is John Singer Sargent. Look at these beautiful paintings here!
