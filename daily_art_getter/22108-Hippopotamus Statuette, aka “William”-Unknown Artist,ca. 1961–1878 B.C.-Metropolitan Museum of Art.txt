The hippopotamus, like many other animals living along the Nile River during ancient times, was frequently the subject of ancient Egyptian art. Blue faience (a type of earthenware) hippopotami, many with flower and plant designs similar to this one, have often been found in Middle Kingdom graves. 
The size, strength, and prevalence of the hippopotamus made it a threat to ancient Egyptians, but they also considered it to have positive traits associated with fertility and rebirth. Therefore, Egyptians frequently included little hippopotamus statuettes among the objects buried in tombs, but they first broke off the creature’s feet to render it harmless. If you look closely, you can see that three of this figure’s four feet are twentieth-century replacements added by museum conservators.
If you’ve fallen in love with this hippo’s cute little face, you’re not alone. He’s so popular among visitors to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he’s lived since 1917, that he’s become the museum’s mascot. William, as he’s affectionately named, appears on the tee shirts, magnets, and replica statuettes sold in the museum’s gift shop. (The writer of this piece owns several.) Children even write letters to him. William has cousins at the Louvre, the Brooklyn Museum, and elsewhere.
