Wojciech Fangor was a Polish painter, graphic designer, poster artist, and sculptor. He was the first Polish artist to have a solo show dedicated to his works at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. He became a leading representative of the Op art movement. In his work he focused on issues of color and light—that light, shown in its spectrum and the chromatic effects of its separation became Fangor's main focus. He produced canvasses composed of colored circles and waves. Today, his works set records on the Polish auction market. We rarely are able to present contemporary artists in DailyArt but today we can, thanks to the National Museum in Kraków. :)
The transitions between colors are elusive; they simultaneously attract and repel the viewer. The lack of clear boundaries between hues introduces a feeling of indeterminacy of form and of melding of colors. In the rings painted by Fangor we can observe the action of the painting technique sfumato, practiced and described by Leonardo da Vinci. Wojciech Fangor used this technique to make the means of expression become the aim of the painting. The correlate of sfumato in Fangor’s work is penetration and indeterminacy. Thanks to the gentle transitions of light and shadow and the blurring of boundaries between contrasting colors, the image achieves a space of visual penetration.
