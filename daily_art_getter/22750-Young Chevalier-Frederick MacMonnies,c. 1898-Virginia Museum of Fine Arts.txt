Frederick MacMonnies (1863–1937) was an American artist best known for his sculpture rather than his paintings. Originally trained in the studio of famed American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens and later working and training in Europe, MacMonnies created many bronzes in the Neoclassical style. He also painted in an Impressionist style, which is what we’re looking at today.
In this charming and comical painting, a young boy is caught in the act of playing soldier. He carries an impressive sword and wears a military-like hat, but his noble horse is actually a toy sheep. Behind him, you can see a sliver of a large tapestry, probably showing much older and larger military heroes. The boy’s expression suggests that he would rather not have his game recorded for everyone to see. He may have been the younger brother of one of MacMonnies’s art students.
This painting is really large—more the size you would expect for a portrait of a real-life military man rather than a child playing pretend. This is probably because MacMonnies had recently visited Spain, where he studied the work of Diego Velasquez, and he was now creating works in a Velasquez-inspired style. Alongside his many large-scale adult portraits, Velasquez also painted many celebrated portraits of children. One that’s particular similar to MacMonnies’s painting is Velasquez’s Prince Baltasar Carlos (1634–1635). That painting, now at the Prado, shows a young boy of a similar age dressed up and riding a horse like you might expect in a heroic adult portrait.

By the way - last week we have presented the painting created by MacMonnies's wife, Mary. Don't miss it! :)
