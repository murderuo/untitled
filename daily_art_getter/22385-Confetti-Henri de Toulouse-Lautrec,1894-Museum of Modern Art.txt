It has been quite a year, at least for us! The next one—at least according to our plans—promises to be even more exciting. Dearest users, we want to wish you a Happy New Year, with the hope that you will have many blessings in the year to come. Thank you for being with us! Enjoy today's evening with this great poster designed by Henri Toulouse-Lautrec—the artist who definitely knew how to party. Of course, with confetti. :)- DailyArt Team
Confetti was commissioned by the confetti makers, J. and E. Bella of London. Inspired by the bubbly Chérettes—posters created by the famous Jules Chéret, Toulouse-Lautrec creates his own miraculous golden-haired winsome young woman, strewn with confetti by anonymous hands from on high.
Lautrec was now deft in applying experimental techniques, and to create an appearance of froth and celebration he adopted the lithographic technique of craquis. Using a hard brush, like a tooth or nail brush filled with liquid tusche, he spattered the brush over the stone, achieving magical results. The arabesque lines and luminous flat colors in golds, reds, and yellows of the young woman’s face, golden hair, and fanciful hat, contrasted with the voguish long dark gloves and collar, all contribute to a trend-setting poster for the mid 1890s.
Have fun today! :)Also, we encourage you to see "10 Photographic Reasons Why You Should Fall In Love with Toulouse-Lautrec" on DailyArtDaily.com. :)
