"Egon Schiele's nudes can challenge us and our preconceptions of the artistic tradition of the nude. He didn't paint or draw idealized goddesses. He preferred to present female and male genitalia in full light. Many of the female nudes reference pornographic images and include props, such as stockings typically associated with prostitution. Schiele often used prostitutes as models but he also made nudes of his sister, lovers, and wife. You can't escape the palpable eroticism of his work, often truly explicit." - this is the first paragraph of our article on our online magazine. 
If you would like to learn more about Schiele's nudes from which most of them are owned by Leopold Museum in Vienna,  you can read more on our article The Pornographic World of Egon Schiele’s Nudes.
Here, for a series of watercolours, Schiele arranged his girlfriend in a sexual embrace with his painter-colleague Felix Albrecht Harta. Here, the man assumes the traditional female position.
