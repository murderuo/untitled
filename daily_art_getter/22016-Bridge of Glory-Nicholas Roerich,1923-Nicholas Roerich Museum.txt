Nicholas Roerich was a Russian painter, writer, archaeologist, theosophist, perceived by some in Russia as an enlightener, philosopher, and public figure, who in his youth was influenced by a movement in Russian society around the occult. He was interested in hypnosis and other spiritual practices and his paintings are said to have hypnotic expression.Born in Saint Petersburg, Russia, to a well-to-do notary public of Baltic German ancestry and a Russian mother, he lived in various places around the world until his death in Naggar, Himachal Pradesh, India. Trained as an artist and a lawyer, his main interests were literature, philosophy, archaeology, and especially art. Roerich was a dedicated activist for the cause of preserving art and architecture during times of war. He earned several nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize long list. Today, Roerich is best known for his contributions to art and culture. In his Banner of Peace address of 1931 he said: “Culture is the accumulation of highest Bliss, highest Beauty, highest Knowledge.”Four years later his brainchild, the Roerich Pact, was signed into action at the White House in 1935. The document declares that “treasures of culture” should be”respected and protected in time of war.”Help us and donate so we will be able to release the new version of DailyArt this autumn: http://support.getdailyart.com
