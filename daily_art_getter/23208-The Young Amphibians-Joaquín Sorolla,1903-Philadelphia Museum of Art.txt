I know we have featured Sorolla's painting yesterday as well - but we just can't get enough of him. His works full of sun and light helps me survive winter in Poland :)

The title of today's painting, “The Young Amphibians”, elicits as much of a smile as does this delightful scene of children playing at the seashore. Spanish artist Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida painted numerous beach scenes in Valencia, the coastal Mediterranean city where he was born. His paintings show elements of Impressionism in the rendering of light on the water and the loose brushstrokes which capture endearing yet fleeting moments. He masterfully depicted sunlight reflecting off the children’s wet skin and gentle waves rolling onto shore. Besides paintings of beach scenes, Sorolla created a series of fourteen monumental murals entitled "The Provinces of Spain", each highlighting the landscape and culture of a region of the Iberian Peninsula. Sorolla was also an accomplished portraitist -- among his famous sitters was William Howard Taft, the 27th President of the United States, in 1909.

P.S. Sorolla spent most of his summers with his family in French Biarritz, chilling on the beach. He was definitely a master of capturing the moment and you will find the proof for it here :)
