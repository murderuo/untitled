Today we have something special for you. For the next four Sundays we will be presenting the masterpieces from the collection of the National Museum of Women in the Arts. It means we will be presenting contemporary art created by women artists. We hope you will like it!
Molecular biologist-turned-photographer Amy Lamb marries her scientific eye and artistic passion to produce exquisite, large-scale portraits of plants—often ones she has grown herself. “I often print my images very large to allow the viewer to delve into the visual ‘soul’ of the flower,” says Lamb.
Here, Lamb’s skillful handling of light and shadow focuses attention on the intricacies of this trumpet-shaped bloom. The datura’s striated neck erupts in a profusion of flamboyantly rippling petals, which dominate the composition. Its variegated purples and whites pop against an inky black background, lending clarity to the complex contours.
