This is one of two formal portraits that Gustav Klimt made of Adele Bloch-Bauer, an important patron of the artist. Adele was the wife of a wealthy industrialist in Vienna where Klimt lived and worked. The composition emphasizes Bloch-Bauer’s social position within Vienna’s cultural elite. Her towering figure, in opulent dress, is set against a jewel-toned backdrop of nearly abstract patterned blocks that suggest a richly decorated domestic interior. Beautiful, isn't it?In 1938, the Nazis took possession of this portrait along with other works of art in the Bloch-Bauer family’s collection. In 2006, after years of legal negotiations, the works were returned to the Bloch-Bauer heirs and subsequently sold to other collections. In November 2006, Christie's auction house sold "Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II" at auction for almost $88 million, the fourth-highest priced piece of art at auction at the time. With this painting we would like honor the memory of Ewa, wife of our generous donor. We are grateful we could be part of your life.
