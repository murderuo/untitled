Today we have for you this beautiful painting created by Van Gogh, from the collection of National Galleries Scotland. It's amazing!
Van Gogh immersed himself in painting the colorful orchards around Arles in the south of France, where he settled in February 1888. The structure of the branches of the plum trees is still clearly visible through the blossom and his brushstrokes follow the direction of the vertical tree trunks. He painted a series of pictures of orchards during his prolific bouts of activity in Arles. His initial optimism, expressed in letters to his brother Theo, encouraged Gauguin to join him there. They soon quarreled, however, being temperamentally incompatible, and the following year Van Gogh's mental illness prompted his admission to the asylum at Saint-Remy.
