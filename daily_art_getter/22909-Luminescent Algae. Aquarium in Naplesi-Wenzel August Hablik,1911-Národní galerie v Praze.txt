We continue our month with Czech art and the collection of the National Gallery in Prague. Enjoy!
A close connection with nature was a typical theme of Hablik’s art. His inspiration from nature is mostly expressed by crystalline and vegetable motifs which are also found in this drawing. Yet, here the stylized, organic, and natural motif changes into a nearly abstract composition, making these types of drawings the precursors of biomorphic abstraction. The way of capturing the underwater world is also reminiscent of the decalcomania technique that was later revived by the surrealists. The drawing comes from the time of the first abstract paintings of František Kupka who also found organic forms important. Similar to Kupka (check out his works in our archive), Hablik’s work has a significant spiritual dimension, expressing a higher order and capturing the cosmic and the universal. Natural sciences meet the spiritual ones, and their boundaries fade away in the oeuvre of both these artists.
Have a great Sunday! : ) BTW. - Happy Mother's Day! :)
P.S. Read about theosophy and art here.
