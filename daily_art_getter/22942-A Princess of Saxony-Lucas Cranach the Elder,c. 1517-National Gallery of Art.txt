There is a companion piece showing a Saxon prince, which we presented yesterdayâ€”swipe left to see it! : )
As John Oliver Hand, noted art historian, wrote: "These pictures rank among Cranach's most engaging and charming portraits of children. In the expressions of the boy and girl the artist has captured the wistful innocence and gentle seriousness of childhood. Depicted in half length against a black background, the pair are regally dressed. [...] The girl's costume is equally splendid. Her dress is a heavy red fabric, perhaps velvet or a dull satin, with a floral pattern in yellow and with slashed and puffed sleeves. At the top of the bodice is a wide piece of cloth-of-gold, and around her shoulders is an elaborate gold chain. A final touch of elegance is provided by the gold necklace edged with delicate white flowers (daisies?) made of enamel."
Nothing to be added here. : ) See you tomorrow!
