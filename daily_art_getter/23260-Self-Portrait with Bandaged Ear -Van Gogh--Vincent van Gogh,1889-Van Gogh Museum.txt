Van Gogh is at once vulnerable and strong in this self-portrait, which offers an intimate image of his mental state in January 1889. Shortly before, he had suffered a nervous breakdown and cut off part of his left ear. Following a period in the hospital, he returned to the Yellow House with his wound bandaged. Things were difficult, yet he continued to paint, making this portrait a powerful statement about his artistic life. Van Gogh presents himself as a painter in his studio with a canvas ready on his easel. He was convinced that painting would help him to heal.
This work is part of the exhibition In the Picture, an exhibition focusing on the role and significance of the artists’ portrait. Now on view at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam until 24 May 2020.
