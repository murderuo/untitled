Today it's our Sunday with New Orleans Museum of Art collection. Enjoy! :)
Mary Cassatt was one of the most prominent female artists of her time. Born in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania, she spent most of her adult life living in France, where she befriended Edgar Degas and became one of the few Americans—and few women—to become closely allied with the French Impressionists. Degas invited her to show her work at some of the first Impressionist exhibitions in Paris in the 1870s, and introduced her to new materials and techniques that helped her arrive at the highly experimental style that eventually won her praise on both sides of the Atlantic. The conventional subject matter of Mother and Child in the Conservatory belies Cassatt’s experimentation with modern techniques and styles, as well as her fierce independence for a woman of the time.
P.S. Watch these beautiful paintings depicting motherhood (and breastfeeding)!
