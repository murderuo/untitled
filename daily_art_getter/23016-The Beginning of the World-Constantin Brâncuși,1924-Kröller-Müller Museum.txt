We often receive emails that you miss sculptures in DailyArt. This month we will change this situation! For the next four Sundays we will present amazing sculptures that are now on display in the exhibition The beginning of a new world in our very favourite Kröller-Müller Museum until 29 September 2019. We start with an absolute classic of 20th century sculpture—a piece by Constantine Brancusi.  
The nickname for The beginning of the world is Brancusi’s egg. According to the artist, this asymmetrical oval represents perfect beauty. The reduced, compact form refers not only to the beginning of the world, but also to the origins and mystery of human life.
A significant part of Brancusi’s work is characterized by abstraction and simplicity. But for him, simplicity is not a goal in itself, nor is abstraction. In his work he seeks to penetrate to the core. "If you approach the actual meaning of things, you achieve simplicity in spite of yourself."
That actual meaning cannot be expressed by depicting people, animals, or objects realistically, as that is merely the exterior. And so Brancusi developed his own visual idiom. These days, he is regarded as the father of modern sculpture.
