Caravaggio, the master of a realistic observation of the human state (both physical and emotional) combined with a dramatic use of lighting, was born exactly 446 years ago. Trained in Lombardy, Caravaggio moved to Rome around 1592, and he initially made his reputation with a number of realistic paintings of half-length figures, such as this one. This canvas was painted for his first great patron, Cardinal Francesco del Monte. Although it was described by contemporaries as "una musica" (a music piece), it is an allegory of music. Cupid is shown at left. The costumes have a vaguely classical look and Caravaggio included his self-portrait in the second boy from the right.
What a magnificent work! Often early Caravaggio is considered to be less interesting than his mature works like Amor Vincit Omnia, but The Musicians is truly amazing (at least to me). ;)
