At age 83, Hopper painted Two Comedians, one of his last paintings, which he intended as a personal statement (a farewell of sorts). As his wife Jo later confirmed, the painting represented the two of them gracefully bowing out. Both were in their eighties and had been ill; Hopper would die less than two years later and Jo the following year. The couple in the scene is like the young lovers Pierrot and Pierrette from the commedia dell'arte. In death, it appears, Hopper preferred company, wanting Jo by his side. She described Two Comedians as "a dark stage (and what a stage, strong as the deck of a ship) and two small figures out of a pantomime." By his choice of theme, Hopper suggested his acceptance of life's ironiesâ€”his realization of the folly of human existence.
