František Kaván painted The Air of Home during his stay in Krkonoše (Giant Mountains) in the autumn of 1895. At that time, the artist was step by step receding from his colleagues in Julius Mařák’s landscape painting studio, more closely approximating the artists from the symbolistic decadent magazine Moderní revue (Modern Revue), mainly Karel Hlavácek. He also began to be engaged in poetry at that time. This painting is a prime work of his oeuvre. The masterful painting of the horizontally composed landscape is incredibly fragile and sensitive. Kaván created an interchangeable and recognizable style of a melancholic and poetic landscape. The simplicity of the delicate colors and sense of detail are extremely strong and intense.
We present this beautiful piece thanks to the National Gallery in Prague.  <3
P.S. For me some landscapes are like postcards from travels. If you feel wanderlust, go here!
