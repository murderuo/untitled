After his return in 1836 from his study trip, Ivan Aivazovsky, a Russian-Armenian Romantic painter who is considered one of the greatest masters of marine art, was awarded the title of Academician of the Imperial Academy of Arts and worked for the Russian Navy as a painter. These new obligations allowed him in the following years to travel with the Russian seaman and geographer Fyodor Litke and to visit Turkey, Greece, and Asia Minor. These trips allowed him to absorb new influences.
The painter began to work on this painting on the January 15th, 1846, and finished it on March 16th of the same year. This painting was displayed on March 18th, 1846, in Feodosia, during an exhibition dedicated to the 10th anniversary of the painter's artistic work. Researchers have suggested that this painting was purchased by Nicholas I, and was then in the possession of the Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich before becoming part of The Marble Palace’s collection.
We present this painting thanks to the State Russian Museum. : )
