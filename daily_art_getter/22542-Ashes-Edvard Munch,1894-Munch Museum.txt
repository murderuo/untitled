In Ashes Munch has depicted a young couple in a dusky forest. The atmosphere is filled with despair and hopelessness. The man sits in the left corner with his head in his hands. His face is green, he looks sick. The woman stands in the center with both hands on her long, red hair. Her eyes are directed towards the viewer and her face is marked by despair and desolation.
Ashes. What is left after a flaming desire?
The motif Ashes is a depiction of absence—the absence of love, but also the absence of interaction, communication, and joy of life. With their emotional posture along with a feeling of guilt that seems to burden them, the couple at the same time has a strong presence.
