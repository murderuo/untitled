Well, today it's International Beer Day! Did you know that? (I didn't!)
Two Laughing Boys with a Mug of Beer is a painting by Frans Hals showing a Kannekijker (mug-looker). Someone looking into a mug refers to an old Dutch word for a glutton, greedy for more. This visual theme was also used to depict sight as one of the five senses. Perhaps this portrait was meant as one in a series of the five senses along with Two Boys Singing for hearing and a variant version of The Smoker for the smell.
Another interesting thing about this painting: it was stolen on 27 April 2011, but luckily it was recovered on 28 October 2011. Uff! :)Here's another happy ending story of a lost piece of art - the Cézanne's painting La Montagne Sainte-Victoire went on view for the first time since before the World War 2.
