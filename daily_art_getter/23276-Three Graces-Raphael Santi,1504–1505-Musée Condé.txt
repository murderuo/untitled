The image of the great Raphael depicts three of the Graces of classical mythology. It is frequently asserted that the artist was inspired in his painting by a ruined Roman marble statue displayed in the Piccolomini Library of the Siena Cathedral—19th-century art historian [Dan K] held that it was a not very skillful copy of that original—but other inspiration is possible, as the subject was a popular one in Italy.
The three women in the painting may represent stages of development of woman, with the girded figure on the left representing the maiden (Chastitas) and the woman to the right maturity (Voluptas),though other interpretations have certainly been advanced.
Well, I don't know if you know, but this year is Raphael's year, as in 2020 we celebrate 500th anniversary of his death. There are plenty exhibitions organised on this occation - and we have listed all of them here :) Enjoy!
