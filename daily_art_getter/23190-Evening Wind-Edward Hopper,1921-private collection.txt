In this work, the viewer catches an unknown individual in the most private of moments. In an everyday scene that acquires drama and mystery in Hopper's hands, a naked woman kneels on the edge of a bed. Her face is veiled by her long hair as she turns her head toward the window in surprise or fear, reacting to the sudden movement of the curtain at the open window. Hopper has included very few details in the interior of the room, so that the scene remains universal in its emotional impact. His etching technique creates a sharp contrast between the darkness of the heavily crosshatched background and the untouched white paper of the space outside the window, and the area of the scene is so shallow that the viewer feels a physical closeness to the woman, as if present in the room with her.
P.S. Hopper is most known for his iconic paintings but he was a gifted sketcher as well. See sketches for The Nighthawks, Morning Sun, and more here!
