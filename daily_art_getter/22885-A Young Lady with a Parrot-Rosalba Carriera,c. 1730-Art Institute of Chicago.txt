March is the month when we take the time to look back and honor the many achievements of women in art history. Have you heard of Rosalba Carriera before? No? This is why in March in DailyArt you will see A LOT of female artists. Also on our Instagram, Facebook, and of course DailyArt Magazine!
Rosalba Carriera is renowned for the distinction she brought to pastel portraiture in Italy and France during the first half of the 18th century. No female artist enjoyed greater success or exerted more influence on the art of her era than Rosalba. A Young Lady with a Parrot is an intriguing combination of what Carriera was most famous for: portraits and allegories. The colorful parrot is a witty conceit that subtly transfers the provocative gesture of baring one’s breast from the young woman to a mischievous bird. The rich colorism and vaporous effects makes A Young Lady with a Parrot one of Rosalba’s finest and most famous portraits. The pastel may depict a young Englishwoman, perhaps one of the daughters of Lord Manchester. Whoever the model, this image’s aura of grace and seduction was to characterize the arts of much of the century, marking Rosalba as one of the originators of the Rococo style in Italy and France.
