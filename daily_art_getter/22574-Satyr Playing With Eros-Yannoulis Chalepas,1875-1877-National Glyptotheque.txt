Yannoulis Chalepas (1851-1938) was a greek sculptor who created many artworks based in mythology. He began art studies when at 19 in Athens. Four years later, he was admitted in the Munich Academy of Fine Arts, where his artworks were admired and awarded. Unfortunately, in 1878 he suffered a mental breakdown and destroyed many sculptures. Chalepas was diagnosed with mental illness and was confined to an asylum. His mother believed that the sculptures were the cause of his illness. Chalepas returned to work in 1916, just before his mother died. He received many prizes and honors. He died in 1938, age 87. The causes of his mental illness, however, never was totally clear.
This work, finished one year after his troubles, shows a satyr (half human and half goat) and Eros, god of love (also known as Cupid). Some critics believe that the cruel face of Satyr and the despair of Eros could represent the relationship of Chalepas and his father, who neither liked nor supported his work. This may be true but I prefer to think that it is just a game between two beautiful creatures.
