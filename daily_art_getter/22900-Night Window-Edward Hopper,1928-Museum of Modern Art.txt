The anonymous woman in Night Windows is unaware of any viewer's gaze. The city at night is a frequent subject in Hopper's work of the late 1920s and early 1930s. As in other Hopper paintings, we see a modern American city and the contradiction it offers between access to the intimate lives of strangers and urban loneliness and isolation.
Returning to the United States in 1907 from his first trip to Paris, Hopper found it "a chaos of ugliness." Hopper was interested in New York's forms and materials of the city's streets and buildings—stone, brick, asphalt, steel, and glass—and the effect of light falling upon them. Light was the most powerful and personal of Hopper's expressive means. He used it as an active element in his paintings to model forms, define the time of day, establish a mood, and create pictorial drama by contrasting it with areas of shadow and darkness.
