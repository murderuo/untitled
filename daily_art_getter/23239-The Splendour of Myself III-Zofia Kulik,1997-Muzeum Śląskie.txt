In The Splendour of Myself III, Zofia Kulik has developed a self-image based on the majestic representation of a monarch who reigned centuries ago, Elizabeth I. Depriving the queen of her hand-held insignia of power, she replaced them with a cucumber and a blossom of St. John’s wort. The unique and symbol-abundant royal attire is woven of repetitively multiplied human figures in mysterious ritual gestures, all portrayed by Zbigniew Libera, Kulik’s model for many years. The artist tends to develop her symbolic photographic worlds using self-created images and multiplied renditions reflecting European history and tradition. In her commentary on the work, Kulik said, “In olden days, wealthy aristocrats collected assorted valuables, jewellery, and curios. I collect images. It could well be said I am rich in images. I wear them.”
P.S. Kulik's work is based on a monarch's portrait. Read here about the power and propaganda in the British royal portraits.
