We continue our month with the collection of National Gallery in Prague—today, with this beautiful painting by Alphonse Mucha. : )
Alphonse Mucha made the portrait of Josephine Crane-Bradley (1886–1952) during his stay in the United States of America at the commission of her father, Charles R. Crane, who was the artist’s friend and benefactor (he financed The Slav Epic series of 20 large canvases). The portrait was commissioned for Josephine’s wedding with Harold C. Bradley, professor of biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin. Mucha portrayed Josephine as a personification of Slavism, simultaneously using her portrait for the poster of Slavia Insurance Company, which was commissioned from him by Bohemia.  Later, he also used it for the one-hundred Czechoslovak banknote. The Bradleys donated the painting through the University of Wisconsin to the National Gallery in Prague.
P.S. You will find here 13 beautiful posters of Alphonse Mucha that you must know!
