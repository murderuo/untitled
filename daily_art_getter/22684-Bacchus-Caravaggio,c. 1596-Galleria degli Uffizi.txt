On this day in 1571, Caravaggio, famous for combining a realistic observation of the human state (both physical and emotional) with a dramatic use of lighting, was born. 
Bacchus was painted shortly after Caravaggio joined the household of his first important patron, Cardinal Del Monte, and reflects the humanist interests of the Cardinal's educated circle. But, as you can see, something is wrong with this Bacchusâ€”his red swollen face. According to some scientists, Caravaggio delivered an accurate and precise diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) with all its neurological and psychiatric symptoms: the skin rosacea; the impaired fine and gross motor movements; the hand tremor resulted in the undulating wine inside the chalice; the possible lost balance resulting in the right elbow hitting the fragile carafe; and the dilated blood vessels revealed by the flushed face, swollen eyelids, and red hands. Pure realism!
Have a great weekend. :) (Don't drink too much!)
