What more can I say - Happy Valentines Day! :)
It was common for people to have themselves portrayed as historical personages. This man and woman chose the loving biblical couple Isaac and Rebecca. Rembrandt veered from the conventional by representing the pair in an intimate and private moment, and by using a thick, impasto manner of painting. He subsequently worked the paint with a palette knife to create a glittering, sculptural sense of relief.
Our today's painting belongs to Rijksmuseum and we present it thanks to Europeana-European Commission's digital platform for cultural heritage.
