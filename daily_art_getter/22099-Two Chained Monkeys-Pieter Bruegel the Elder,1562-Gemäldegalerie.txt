The picture shows two monkeys chained to an iron ring and sitting in a vaulted window opening. The two sad animals have obviously come to terms with their sad fate. One is crouching on the floor, with his back bent and huddling in on himself, staring into space, while the other is looking at the viewer. These forlorn prisoners from the jungle are painted with scientific exactitude after species imported from Africa. Monkeys are emblematic of the painter's imitative function as well as of human folly. Behind them is a view of an open landscape, flooded with bright daylight, and seen without transition, as though from a high look-out post. The city of Antwerp basks under a pale blue sky.
