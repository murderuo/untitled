We present today's painting thanks to Dulwich Picture Gallery in London.  : )
This is a good example of what has come to be known as a "swagger portrait." The face, painted in a startlingly real manner, is set off by the generalized glamour of Digby’s cloak, swept over the shoulder to suggest a Roman toga, and painted with broad, bravura brushwork.
George Digby (1612–1677) married Anne Russell, daughter of the Earl of Bedford, in 1632. He was elected MP for Dorset in 1640 and created Baron Digby in 1641. An ardent Royalist during the Civil War, he fled to France and served in the French army. He was appointed secretary of state by Charles II in 1657 but converted to Catholicism and lost favor. He was also a poet and playwright. 
P.S. If the Earl's moustache caught your attention you will definitely enjoy our selection of moustaches in paintings here! :)
