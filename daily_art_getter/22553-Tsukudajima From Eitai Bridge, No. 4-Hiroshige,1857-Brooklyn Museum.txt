I love the quiet atmosphere of this woodcut. This is how I imagine a peaceful night at the seacoast.
This view in Edo Bay is one of only a few prints in this series in which Hiroshige portrayed a starlit sky. The fishing boats have come from Tsukudajima Island, which you can see in the moonlight. In this area the fishermen employed by the shogun were catching tiny translucent fish, shirauo (white fish), whose bland taste was favored by the shogun himself.

Do you like “ukiyo-e”? There is one type of it that isn’t presented so often as "36 Views of Mount Fuji". It’s the type that Western visitors to Japan of the late nineteenth century were very surprised when they’ve discovered it. Read about "Shunga" in the article "All You Must Know About Japanese Erotic Art, Shunga (18+)".
