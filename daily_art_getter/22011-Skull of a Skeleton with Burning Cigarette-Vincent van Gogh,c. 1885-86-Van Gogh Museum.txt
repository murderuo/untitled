Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette is an early work —and the most macabre—created by Vincent van Gogh. It was probably painted in the winter of 1885-86 when Vincent travelled to Antwerp to enroll in an art academy, in order to have the opportunity to draw and paint after the live model. But the students at Antwerp’s traditional academy learned by copying prints and studying plaster casts. After they had progressed sufficiently, they were permitted to study the live model. Skeletons were often used to help them understand human anatomy. This skull can be a humorous comment on conservative academic practices, showing van Gogh's disappointment. It could also be a vanitas or memento mori, at a time when Van Gogh was himself in poor health, due to stomach ailments and rotting teeth. Van Gogh was a keen smoker, and continued to smoke until his death in 1890.There is nothing I can add to it.We wish you a Happy Halloween :)- DailyArt TeamHelp us and donate so we will be able to release the new version of DailyArt this autumn: http://support.getdailyart.com
