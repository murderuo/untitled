Recently, The Van Gogh Museum acquired a total of 91 prints by Camille Pissarro (1830–1903). The prints are from the Samuel Josefowitz Collection, and were amassed over many decades with great passion, expertise, and patience. The entire collection has now been acquired by the museum. Together, the works provide a comprehensive overview of the artist’s printed oeuvre.
Camille Pissarro was one of the leading and most productive representatives of Impressionist printmaking, creating some 200 etchings and lithographs during his career. The sizeable collection of the 91 prints reveals the extent of Pissarro’s experimental approach and contains innumerable unique pieces, including this sought-after self-portrait by the artist. This is a self-portrait of Pissarro later in life, the only such work he ever etched. In the artists own words, he made it for his friends. It is an intimate work in which the 60-year-old artist intently stares at you. Reminiscent of the self-portrait of the aged Rembrandt, this became his most sought-after print.
From 1 March to 26 May, 2019, 42 of the acquired prints will be on display in a special presentation in the print cabinet in the Exhibition Wing of the museum.
P.S. In July 1890, van Gogh painted one of his best-known artworks, Wheatfield with Crows. You can see it in the Van Gogh Museum and read about it here!
