We continue presenting the masterpieces from the exhibition "Bonnard/Vuillard. The collection of Zeïneb and Jean-Pierre Marcie-Rivière" held at the Musée Bonnard. Until September 17th the exhibition will present the paintings and drawings from the private collection of Zeïneb & Jean-Pierre Marcie-Rivière which is now owned by the Musée d’Orsay. Enjoy! :)
Édouard Vuillard painted interiors from the beginning of his carrier and this composition is quintessential Les Nabis period.
Young Girl, the Hand on a Doorknob is one of the intimate scenes presenting his family.The awkward and shy (almost grotesque) appearance of his sister, Marie, gives a unique charm to this portrait of the young girl who’s about to open a door. The theme strongly resonates with the modern dramatic symbolist repertoire of the oneiric refinement that became an inspiration for the artist on the occasion of the opening of the Théâtre d’Art of Paul Fort. The painting, with the effect of sliding or intertwining between the shape and the background, can be considered a parable of the idea of unveiling the truth gradually, which was one of the main characteristic of the symbolist drama. Marie stands out against the ochre background while her speckled dress blends into it.
