This scene is extracted from Orlando Furioso, an Italian epic poem written in 1516 by the poet and writer Ludovico Ariosto.
Roger, a Frankish knight, has just saved the beautiful Angelica from an aquatic dragon. Fortified by his success and losing his mind in front of the young and nude girl, he tries to take advantage of the situation. While he is trying to take off his armor with utmost difficulty, Angelica is inserting an invisibility ring in her mouth—a magical object that will allow her to disappear from sight.
In the background, Pegasus, the knight’s mount, flies away to seek a knight with more noble intentions than Roger. Having taken off his armor, the latter will stay alone, aggrieved, and ashamed, trying to make up for his behavior in heroic battles.
We present today's painting thanks to Herve Quicaille & Anne Laure who spotted this painting in Dijon, requested it, and helped in translation from French. :) Thank you!
