Ballet dancers were a frequent subject in mid-nineteenth century art. Of course we all know Degas' ballerinas. Although looking glamorous, the life of ballet dancers wasn't an easy one. Dancing girls were usually young working-class girls that took an opportunity to escape a life of poverty. With any luck, a ballet dancer would make her stage performance and start earning money at the age of 14 or 15. Although an average dancer would earn the same as a seamstress, the exposure she got on the stage could spark the attention of a wealthy gentleman who could become her patron and open the door to a better life. In this pastel drawing, Carrier-Belleuse shows a quiet moment between two young dancers. While taking a break from their grueling practice schedule, the girls are playing a game called “Pigs in the Pen,” which is similar to the game Jacks and is played with the ankle bones of a sheep.See you tomorrow!
