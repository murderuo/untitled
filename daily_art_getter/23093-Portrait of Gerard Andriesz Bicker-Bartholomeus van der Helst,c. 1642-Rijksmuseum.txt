Today we present a portrait that cannot be missed when you visit the Rijksmuseum. Here is Gerard Bicker at 20, portrayed as self-assured with his arm akimbo. Gerard wears a colorful and showy outfit with a flat collar and elegant gloves. Gerard was not awarded many key administrative positions in Amsterdam but he will surely be remembered forever because of this portrait.  : )
P.S. Gerard seems not to care too much for diets! So keep eating and never regret with these delicious paintings. :D
