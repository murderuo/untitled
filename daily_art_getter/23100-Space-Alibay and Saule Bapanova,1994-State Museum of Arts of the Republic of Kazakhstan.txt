Artists have turned the mysterious nature of environment into an artwork. Let's turn to the art of Kazakh tapestry, which came from the depths of centuries. For the tapestry, which is based on compositions created by the interweaving of colored threads, the texture of wool (thick-thin threads), coloristic harmony, technical and aesthetic qualities are very important.
Famous Kazakh artists Alibay Bapanov and Saule Bapanova reflect in their work the vast expanses of the Kazakh steppe and the mysterious nature of being (existence), celebrating the national culture. In the tapestry "Space" Alibay and Saule Bapanova strain after conveying the power of being in the composition through the mountains, which are a kind of intermediary in space between Heaven and Earth. Through the patchwork reflection of the earth mountain in the sky, the artists try to convey the close relationship between Earth and Cosmic Space. The procession of a shepherd and sheeps is as a part of history coming from the depths of centuries and going into the vast space of the future, as a boundary state of two worlds - terrestrial and superterrestrial. This narrative unconsciously refers us to Tengrism, where a nomad worships the goddess Umay and the Heavenly-Father of Tengri, and appears as a witness of eternal life. 
Using in practice a dynamic harmony of different colors and shades, a combination of contrasting colors in different compositions, artists harmoniously combine artistic and thematic solutions.
Thus, each compositional idea, adopting the experience of the past and referring to the present, gives an understanding of further way.
