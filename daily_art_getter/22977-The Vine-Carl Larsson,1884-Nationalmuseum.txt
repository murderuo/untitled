The Vine can be interpreted as a light-hearted allegory of love:  the woman harvests the grapes for the wine that intoxicates the man. With his great technical virtuosity, Carl Larsson was excellently equipped to succeed in the Neo-Rococo genre, which relied to a great extent on the ability to paint with illusory brilliance. The Vine was bought by Herman Friedländer when it was shown at the Opponent Exhibition Vid Seinens Strand (On the Seine River Bank) in Stockholm in 1885. Friedländer later lent it to the World’s Fair in Paris in 1889.
We present The Vine today thanks to the Nationalmuseum in Sweden. : )
