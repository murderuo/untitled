This is a multicolored lithograph poster produced by Lautrec, who made a meteoric debut with the poster Moulin Rouge: La Goulue and reigned over the fin-de-siecle world of graphic art. This lithograph was created for La Revue Blanche, an avant-garde art magazine published in Paris. This magazine was edited by the three Polish brothers Natanson. The chief editor Thade Natanson’s wife, Misia, was like a muse for many artists such as Proust and Debussy who frequented her salon. Lautrec was the second artist to be employed to design a poster for this magazine after Bonnard's poster from 1894.
