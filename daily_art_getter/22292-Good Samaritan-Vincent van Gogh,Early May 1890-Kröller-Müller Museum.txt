When van Gogh was painting this piece, he was staying in an institution for the mentally ill. It is a mirrored copy of Eugène Delacroix's Good Samaritan. Van Gogh also made a copy of Delacroix's Pietà. 
The painting shows a classic Biblical story. The man from Samaria pushes the robbed man onto his horse. In the background two men can be seen, a priest and a man from the important house of Levi, who let the wounded man lay on the road as they passed him by. Only the Samaritan helped the wounded man.
