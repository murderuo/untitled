Hope you are having a nice Saturday! 
To keep you in a more chillout mood, thanks to Terra Foundation for American Art we present today's painting. Charles Courtney Curran presents here a casual glimpse of public life in a modern city park.
Curran painted this work during the second year he spent in Paris as a student at the popular Académie Julian. Like many fellow American artists studying and working in Paris in the late nineteenth century, he was fascinated by daily life in the French capital. The Luxembourg Gardens, originally a private preserve designed in the 1620s for the palace of Marie d’Medici, was one of the more celebrated Parisian parks - and it remained like this until this day. Amazing how similar scenes you can observe there nearly 130 years after this painting was created!
