Today is the Day of Assumption of Mary which celebrated the Christian belief that God assumed the Virgin Mary into Heaven following her death. On this occasion we have today this beautiful El Greco. :)
El Greco's Assumption of the Virgin was the central element in his first major Spanish commission, a set of paintings for the church of the Cistercian convent of Santo Domingo el Antiguo Toledo. The  huge retable filled the end of the sanctuary. The Assumption of the Virgin was flanked by paintings of single saints and crowned by a depiction of the Trinity. Side altars with pictures of the Resurrection and the Adoration of the Shepherds completed the complex. The space before the high altar contained the tombs of the church's donor, Doña Maria de Silva, and of Don Diego de Castilla, dean of the cathedral of Toledo, who commissioned the work.
El Greco, who had previously worked on a much smaller scale, attached his signature in Greek at the lower right: Domenikos Theotokopoulos, Cretan, displayed this 1577.
