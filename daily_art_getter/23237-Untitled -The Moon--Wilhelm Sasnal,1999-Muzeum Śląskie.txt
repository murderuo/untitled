We present today's painting thanks to the Silesian Museum in Katowice and The ING Polish Art Foundation, where you can see The Spirit of Nature and Other Fairy Tales until 3 May 2020. Enjoy!  : )
Wilhelm Sasnal’s world of painting reaches deep into individual and collective historical remembrance, his oeuvre featuring the power of an anarchist manifesto. The painting, subtitled The Moon and citing an archival photographic image, shows the moment of the “giant leap for mankind.” The artist selected and painted a historical event in enigmatic and ambiguous form. Discernible brushstrokes and reduced details suggest the work to be documentary in nature, created swiftly and in emulation of a photographic image.
Wilhelm Sasnal (born December 29, 1972) is a Polish painter, photographer, poster artist, illustrator, and filmmaker. Today, he is considered one of the most prominent and internationally successful Polish contemporary artists.
P.S. For more traditional depictions of the moon check this lovely selection of the full moon in paintings.
