This rather unusual fan print design is by Hiroshige II who often closely followed the style and designs of his immensely successful mentor. This print, however, reflects Hiroshige II's own unique approach. It shows the artist's close observation of a house cat, depicted in a bold and minimal manner. This cute and chubby white bobtail cat is biting a blue string. With hind legs braced against the ground, he appears ready to pounce.
This cat reminds me of Marlon the Cat (in Polish: Kot Pimpa) who is trying to kill the cable of my computer charger right now. Well, cats will never change. Only strings do.
