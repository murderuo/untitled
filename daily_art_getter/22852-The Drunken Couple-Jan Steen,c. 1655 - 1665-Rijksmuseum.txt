We present today's painting thanks to the Rijksmuseum.  ; ) 
A man and woman are so drunk that they are unaware they are being robbed. Their foolishness is underscored by the print on the partition. It depicts an owl, considered a stupid creature in the 17th century. After all, it could not see by day, not even with a candle or eyeglasses. The drunken couple is thus just as blind as the owl, a message that survives in English as "blind as a bat."
Today is the last day of the year. Take care, have fun, be careful with drinking.  See you tomorrow in 2020! Remember that here you can buy some DailyArt Calendars for 2020. : )
P.S. We don't think that owls are stupid. Actually, we quite like them! See our selection of Hieronymus Bosch’s creepy owls here. <3
