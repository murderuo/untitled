Andrea del Sarto was an Italian painter from Florence, whose career flourished during the High Renaissance and early Mannerism. Though highly regarded during his lifetime as an artist senza errori ("without errors"), his renown was eclipsed after his death by that of his contemporaries, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael.
Madonna of the Harpies is the artist's best-known work. The painting depicts Virgin and Child standing on a pedestal which includes harpies sculpted in relief, from which the painting takes its name. They are flanked by putti angels and two saints, Saint Bonaventure or Francis and John the Evangelist.  
The painting was made for a convent of nuns, and the harpies, figures from pagan mythology, here represent temptation and sin, which the Virgin has conquered and stands upon. The Christ Child is shown as old, and has an athletic contrapposto pose. He looks down to the putti, and all three have a "mischiefness" that contrasts with the serious, abstracted, air of the adults.
