Today is our last Sunday of the special month with Renoir's pieces from The Clark collections. I miss Venice when I look at this painting!
When Renoir first visited Venice in 1881, he was drawn to one of its most famous sights: the façade of the Doge’s Palace across from the island of San Giorgio Maggiore. This view was very popular with artists; Renoir joked that “there were at least six of us queuing up to paint it.” The buildings are painted with considerable accuracy, the soft pinks and creams of their sunlit walls contrasting with the rich blue of the sky and reflecting in the undulating waters of the canal.
P.S. See Venice Carnival in paintings here.
