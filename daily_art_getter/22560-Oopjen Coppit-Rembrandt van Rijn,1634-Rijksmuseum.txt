From March 8 to June 3, 2018, The Rijksmuseum presents a magnificent exhibition, High Society, covering four centuries of glamour in portrait art by the great masters of the history of art, including Cranach, Veronese, Velázquez, Reynolds, Gainsborough, Sargent, Munch, and Manet. You can read more about this great show here. If you can't visit Amsterdam, however, we have something special for you—we will feature a couple of great portraits from the exhibition in DailyArt. Like today!
Oopjen was the eldest of three daughters of an old, affluent Amsterdam family. She sat for Rembrandt one year after her marriage. She was 23 and pregnant with her first child. The marriage represented an alliance between families, old and new money. This was celebrated with the commission of monumental likenesses from the city’s leading portraitist, namely Rembrandt van Rijn.
Oopjen had a husband—Marten. Tomorrow we will present his portrait, also painted by Rembrandt. ;)
