Delilah is a woman mentioned in the sixteenth chapter of the Book of Judges in the Hebrew Bible. She is loved by Samson, a Nazirite who possesses great strength and serves as the final Judge of Israel. Delilah is bribed by the lords of the Philistines to discover the source of his strength. After three failed attempts at doing so, she finally goads Samson into telling her that his vigor is derived from his hair. As he sleeps, Delilah orders a servant to cut Samson's hair, thereby enabling her to turn him over to the Philistines.
We can see this scene here. Lulled to sleep by Delilah, Samson is lying in a dramaticall pose. The Philistine guards lie in wait ready to capture and imprison him as soon as the deed is done. In Van Dyck’s scene, Delilah is in the focus. The light within the painting is focused on her, while the edges of the canvas recede into darkness. She is shown bejewelled and in a state of undress, draped in luxurious silk and lounging on a bed covered with rich, brocaded fabric. Delilah’s soft and milky-white skin is in complete contrast to the swarthy Samson, who is covered with only a fur loincloth. Van Dyck heightens the drama further by giving the barber what appear to be giant sheep shears,
It seems that any normal scissors would do the same job, but we won't argue with the artist.
