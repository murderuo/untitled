Berthe Morisot was the only female painter who took part in the first Impressionist exhibition in Nadar’s studio, in 1874. In the same year she married Eugène Manet (1833-1892), Edouard Manet’s brother, who had painted her portrait several times. 

During her first exhibition in Nadar’s studio, the young woman exhibited pastel and watercolour works and four paintings which included The Cradle, painted in 1872 (check our Archive to see it!), which depicts her sister Edma watching her sleeping daughter. After these noteworthy beginnings, Berthe continued to exhibit regularly with the group and built strong friendships with painters and writers with similar artistic interests. Monet and the poet Mallarmé were very close friends of her and her family. Renoir was also a loyal companion, particularly at the end of Berthe Morisot’s life. They sometimes painted together and exchanged themes and ideas.
We conitnue our special month with women artists. Also, we present this painting thanks to Petit Palais which recently along with other 13 Paris Museums placed 100,000 works of art online for free download :) Check their website here and here to read about another beautiful painting of Morisot - Woman at Her Toilette <3
