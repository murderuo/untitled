ZdzisLaw Beksinski was a Polish painter, photographer, and sculptor, specializing in the field of dystopian surrealism. Beksinski did his paintings and drawings in what he called either a Baroque or a Gothic manner. His creations were made mainly in two periods. The first period of work is generally considered to contain expressionistic color with a strong style of utopian realism and surreal architecture, like a doomsday scenario. The second period saw a more abstract style, with the main features of formalism.
Beksinski was stabbed to death at his Warsaw apartment in February 2005 by a 19-year-old acquaintance, reportedly because he refused to lend the teenager money.
This is a painting from the so-called fantastic period in Beksinski's art. The painter's goal was to present his internal visions; he was extremely focused on details. Despite shapes and figures that are sorely realistic, Beksinski is still considered to be the representative of surrealism. This painting was created in 1976 using warm colors and oil paint. Like other pieces, it has no title. Beksinski did not title his paintings so as not to spoil the viewer’s process of interpretation. An inquisitive person will find in the picture not only human-shaped figures and a nightmarish horse, but also a sanguin forest laced with blowing leaves (or perhaps birds).
