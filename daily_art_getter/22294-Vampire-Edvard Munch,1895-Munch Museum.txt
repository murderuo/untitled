We present today's painting thanks to The Munch Museum :) I'm super happy about it as Munch is one of my favorite painters—and what do you think about his art? :)
The motif is simple and concentrated in its mode of expression. A woman with long red hair leans over a man; Medusa-like, her red hair binds him to her. The couple cast a single shadow that joins them in a classic pyramidal composition. Love and pain, which was the first title of the motif, reveals an ambition to give visual expression to complex emotions.
See you tomorrow!
