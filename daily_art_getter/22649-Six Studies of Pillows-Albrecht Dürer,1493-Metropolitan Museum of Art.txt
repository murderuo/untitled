This drawing is made on the reverse of the 22-year-old German Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer's self-portrait. But what interests us more today are the pillows. Dürer made a series of sketches of pillows, exploring the effects of light on the folds in a manner reminiscent of drapery studies. The varying forms and textures of the pillows—some are twisted, faceted, and deeply contoured, while others have smooth, flat areas—reveal his detailed attention to the many configurations of the everyday object.
This drawing always comes to my mind when I'm very very tired. In case you have also felt tired and thought about a bed, here is a story of Vincent van Gogh’s bedroom (and its three versions).
How not to love Dürer? :)
See you tomorrow!
