Jan Mankes (1886-1920) was a Dutch painter known for his paintings of landscapes, animals, and simple farm life. He created over 200 paintings, drawings, and prints in his lifetime. Mankes was a man of enormous talents who had a distinct, unique, and very captivating style. He lived a quiet, isolated life away from the city, preferring the simplicity of the Dutch countryside and the pleasures of animals and nature. He carefully selected, studied, and sketched his subjects before beginning his paintings. Big Owl (1913) is a painting of his pet owl who lived with him in his home. The owl was a gift from his benefactor, A.A.M. Pauwels, who encouraged and collected Mankes artwork. He used a glazing technique of applying multiple layers of paint on an opaque base to create a soft, lustrous, and dreamlike canvas. Mankes died of tuberculosis at the young age of 30, leaving behind a stunning breadth of work for such a short life. One can only imagine the magnificent works this talented artist may have created had he lived longer. If you are visiting the Netherlands, be sure to see his works at Museum of Modern Art Arnhem, Museum Belvédère Heerenveen, and Museum MORE Gorssel. - Heidi Werber
