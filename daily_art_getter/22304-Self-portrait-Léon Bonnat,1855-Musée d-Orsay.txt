Léon Joseph Florentin Bonnat (1833-1922) was born in Bayonne, France. He developed into a skilled painter and later a renowned teacher to many students who became exceptional artists.
His earlier works were focused on religious paintings influenced by the Spanish Baroque style while studying under Federico de Madrazo in Madrid; he was also a great admirer of Velazquez. Later his subject matter focused on portraiture of prominent people in both America and Europe. His portraits show a firm command of realism as his depictions are almost photo-like in their authenticity. His use of more subdued colors in his palette helps bring more focus to his subjects.
At age 55 he became a professor of painting at the esteemed École des Beaux-Arts, and later, the Director. If his success as a teacher can be judged by his pupils, Bonnat can be considered very successful as painters such as Toulouse-Lautrec, Thomas Eakins, John Singer Sargent, George Braque, and more thrived under his tutelage.
Bonnat was a prolific painter with many great works; I have chosen to highlight Leon Bonnat-Self-Portrait (1855). This painting shows Bonnat’s mastery of painting at a young age of 22. Clearly he is a talented artist; it is his arresting gaze, however, that stops the viewer and beckons you to look more closely. Bonnat’s piercing, and intimate glance seems to command your attention as if he has just told you a deep, dark secret. He depicts a powerful self-portrait that makes you want to know more about the man as well as the artist.
Bonnat lived a long life and died at age 89, leaving behind a museum he gifted to his birthplace of Bayonne where many of his works are still on display.
