For the next three weeks every Sunday we will present masterpieces created by two great artists - the sculptor French Auguste Rodin and the Polish artist Xavery Dunikowski. All of them depict women. To find more about this great exhibition, visit the website of the National Museum in Krakow. Enjoy! :)Xawery Dunikowski perceived art as a sacred profession and his own artistic path as a mission, or vocation. According to Rodin, the art is “the most sublime mission of man, since it is exertion of mind trying to understand the world and make the world understood”. In the light of many self-referential statements, both artists appear as mythomaniacs persuaded of their own exceptionality and genius.Self-Portrait. I Go Towards the Sun exposing the power, vitality and virility of phallus is an exceptional work in Dunikowski’s oeuvre. The artist himself stated that this was his “astral self-portrait; as if a vision from the inside. A synthesis of this desire pushing one into cosmos that man carries inside him”. At the same time, the figure with two faces (one directed to the ground and the other, worn like a mask, facing the sky), holding “crystals” in his hand, brings to mind the Promethean myth.We are preparing the new version of DailyArt.
