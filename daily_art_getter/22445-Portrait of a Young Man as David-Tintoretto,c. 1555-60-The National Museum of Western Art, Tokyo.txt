This work was originally in the collection of the famous British art historian, Sir Kenneth Clark, and represents the portrait of a young man in the guise of the Old Testament (1 Samuel 17.1-58) hero, David. The body of the Philistine Goliath slain by David and fleeing Philistine troops can be seen in the left background, all depicted in such an energetic manner that Sir K. Clark noted, "they bring to mind Delacroix." It is thought that the figure shown is the scion, appropriately named David, belonged to the famous Venetian family. This individual is thought to be the same figure shown in Paolo Veronese's Man in Furs from Museum of Fine Arts Budapest.
