One of a set of two, semicircular copper plaques, this piece prominently features its likely commissioner, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester from 1129 to 1171. Henry was recognized for his talents and was promoted by his uncle, King Henry I of England, and later saw his elder brother, Stephen, ascend to the English throne in 1135. A colorful, opportunistic, and somewhat power-hungry character, Henry of Blois was also an exceptional patron, sponsoring and overseeing a wide range of architectural projects and several impressive literary productions. He, like many churchmen, also admired the arts, and this plaque is one surviving example of his material enthusiasm.
This plaque shows Bishop Henry kneeling before a portable altar. While Henry refers to himself as a “slave” who is responsible for England’s well-being and prosperity in an inscription on the other plaque in this pair, on this piece, Henry declares his love of art and its personal meaning. “Art,” it states, “comes before gold and gems,” and Henry himself is “alive in bronze” while he “gives gifts to God.” Although it is unclear what purpose these pieces were intended to serve, Bishop Henry clearly intended them to stand as a testament to his contribution and to his love of God, of art, and of timeless beauty.
