Michelangelo is possibly the most revolutionary artist in history. He stands alone as a master of painting, sculpture and architecture. Throughout his career he re-defined the practice of art itself. He clashed with popes and patrons promoting the idea that it was the artist rather than the lord behind the creative force. 
The Pieta, Michelangelo’s marble masterpiece shows us how the brash young man of twenty four was anxious to show the world he can achieve. His controversial decision at the time in depicting Mary as a young woman, even younger than the child she supports, was to show how he interpreted the purity of the virgin. Her other hand is inviting us to the scene, as if to say this is my beloved child who offered himself for the sake of mankind. Michelangelo was also faced with a challenge in depicting the Christ dead naked figure with very unrivaled anatomy that let us feel the weight of his body as Mary is supporting him.
The said Michelangelo will make this work within one year, and … it will be the most beautiful marble that there is today in Rome, and no other living master will do better.
