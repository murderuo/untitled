We present today's painting thanks to the National Galleries of Scotland :)
Cursiter was the last distinguished Royal Scottish Academician to be appointed Director of the National Galleries, a tradition dating back to the inauguration of the National Gallery (now Scottish National Gallery) in 1859. This is one of a series of studies painted by Cursiter as Director (1930-48), exploring alternative ideas for interior color schemes and picture hangers. The Corinthian columns and shallow domes designed by Cursiter were removed in 1988, restoring the interior to its original appearance.
And what is your favorite museum interior?
See you tomorrow!
