The reign of Hyder Ali and his successor, Tipu Sultan (Tipu Sahib), was a time of great political unrest in Mysore. The British East India Company was gaining a foothold over the Indian subcontinent. There were also frequent skirmishes with Mysore's neighboring states and rebellions within the kingdom. Tipu formed an alliance with Louis XVI and sent ambassadors to the Ottoman Empire to strengthen Mysore’s political power and boost their arsenal. In 1790, after two unsuccessful military campaigns, a British-led coalition of the Travancores, the Marathas, and the Nizam of Hyderabad finally overthrew Tipu Sultan in the Third Anglo-Mysore war.
Lord General Cornwallis negotiated an arrangement for a division of the acquired Mysorean territories among the allied forces. The annexed territories deprived Mysore of much of its coastline. Mysore was also obliged to pay substantial war tributes. To guarantee execution of the cease-fire terms, Cornwallis required the surrender of two of Tipu's sons as hostages. On February 23, 1792, the two young sons were formally delivered to Cornwallis amid great ceremony and gun salutes by both sides. This ceremony was highly documented by many artists of the time. 
This rendering was created by Robert Smirke. Smirke was an English painter who specialized in small paintings. He distinguished himself for his renditions of biblical, literary, and historical scenes such as this one.
