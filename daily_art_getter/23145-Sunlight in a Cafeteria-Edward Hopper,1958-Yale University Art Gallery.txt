On this Hopper's painting we see a man and woman seated at separate tables in a sunny cafeteria. They are the only customers. What interests the artist is the suspenseful moment before a first tentative contact is made, the mental and emotional forcefield that can arise between two strangers.
Do you remember The Nighthawks? Here we have the same story, but in reverse. Instead of a diner with counterman we see a cafeteria with no one to wait on the customers. Instead of a nocturnal scene, we have bright daylight. Instead of looking into an interior from out-side, we are inside looking out. But the most important difference is that the night owls have apparently come to the diner together, and here the two cafeteria guests are strangers. The harsh shadow-line between man and woman will not be overcome unless one of them takes the initiative.
Have a great Saturday!
P.S. Edward Hopper mastered catching the moments of loneliness and enclosing them in paintings. See it here!
