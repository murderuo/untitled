We present today’s masterpiece thanks to the Getty Museum. Hope you will like it:
Time for something medieval! And it will be a party :D
Set before a luxurious cloth of honor, the elevated banquet scene in the background features upper-class diners and an obedient servant arranged symmetrically in their proper places around a carefully laid table. In contrast, at the disheveled table in the foreground, rowdy peasants ply each other with drink while one of them falls asleep, a woman cavorts with a man seated on the floor, and a server crudely lifts her dress. At left Valerius Maximus, author of this text about ancient customs and heroes, gestures to the disorderly scene to explain the merits of temperance to the Emperor Tiberius (ruled A.D. 14 – 37).
See you tomorrow ;)
