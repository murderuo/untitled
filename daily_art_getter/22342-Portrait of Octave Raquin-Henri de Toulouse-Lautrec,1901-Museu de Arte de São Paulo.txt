Today we present out last painting from the exhibition "Toulouse-Lautrec in Red" which until today you could explore in Museu de Arte de SÃ£o Paulo. We will come back with out special monthly feature in two weeks - by now, enjoy this beautiful Toulouse-Lautrec!
In this painting, we see an elegant man seated in an armchair, in a dark interior setting. Toulouse-Lautrec dedicated the painting to Octave Raquin himself, who was his friend, but it is not known if it was on commission or as a gift. Raquin was an architect; one of the buildings he designed still can be seen today at 33 Rue du Champ de Mars, in Paris. Built in 1900 in art nouveau style, the building has been designated as an official historical monument.
