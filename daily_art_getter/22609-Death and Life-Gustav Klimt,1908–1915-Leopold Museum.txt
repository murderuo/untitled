On this day in 1862 Gustav Klimt, one of the most prominent members of the Vienna Secession movement was born.
But today we will speak not only about his birth, but also about death in general. Death was a fascinating theme for many artists. It was frequently imagined as a personified force, also known as the Grim Reaper, a living skeleton who causes the victim’s death by coming to collect them. In turn, people in some stories try to hold on to life by avoiding Death’s visit, or by fending Death off with bribery or tricks. But this part of the visual imaginary won’t be a thing in today’s painting.
But this painting is different. Next to Death (who holds a club!), gazing at “life” with a malicious grin we see the human surge which conveys a vibrant and hopeful impression. Naked bodies are huddled together and surrounded by a colorful abundance of flowers and ornamentation. Every age group is represented, from the baby to the grandmother, in this depiction of the never-ending circle of life. Death may be able to swipe individuals from life, but life itself, humanity as a whole, will always elude his grasp. In a bold composition, the image represents a universal allegory through which the Viennese artist exemplified the cycle of human life. The circle of life repeats itself.If you want to know what makes Klimt so famous, check it here :)
