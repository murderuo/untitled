By the time Maharana Bhim Singh ascended to the throne, the kingdom of Mewar was a mere shell of its former glory. To defend what was left of it from the influential Mughal Empire and to gain an edge over squabbling Rajput kingdoms at their borders, Bhim Singh formed alliances with the British East India Company in 1818.  
One may never guess Mewar’s state of turmoil by looking at this artwork. Maharana Bhim Singh is portrayed on his decorated horse in all his royal finery. The hookah in the Maharana’s hand as well as the leashed cheetah and falcon in his entourage adds a touch of casual opulence and power that is typically associated with Rajput rulers. 
This painting from the Rajasthan school has been attributed to Ghasi, a highly accomplished miniaturist. He also created large court and architectural scenes under the employ of Maharana Bhim Singh. Ghasi’s works were known for his careful portrayal of the hierarchy and protocol of 19th century darbars (royal courts) and his training as a miniaturist is evident even in his large-scale compositions. Ghasi's career was further boosted under the employ of Lieutenant-Colonel James Tod of the East India Company, for whom he created architectural drawings.- Maya Tola
P.S. Get to know Amrita Sher-Gil, called India’s Frida Kahlo.
