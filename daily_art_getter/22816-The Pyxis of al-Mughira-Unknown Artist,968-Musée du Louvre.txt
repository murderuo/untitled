Between 711 and 1492, some Spanish territories occupied by Muslim rulers developed a cosmopolitan culture through art and architecture. The Pyxis of al-Mughira is the best example of the sophisticated royal art craft, created at the Spanish Umayyad court.
This luxurious ivory container may have been used for holding a precious material such as perfume. It also expresses a strong political message, made for the son of the Caliph of Cordoba.
All around the pyxis, four medallions display scenes with characters and animals. This view present two riders picking clusters of dates from a palm tree.  The palm tree is a symbol of the lost Eastern lands and remind us of the tragic event of the Umayyad dynasty: as they ruled from Damascus over lands from Spain to India, the Abbasid dynasty overthrew them and seized power in the empire. The last Umayyad then took exile in Spain, and established the Spanish Umayyad court. The palm tree comes from the Middle East, and symbolizes the lost Umayyad homeland.
The abounding iconography displays a lot of animals, including lions, eagles, and peacocks. They refer either to poetry or to court entertainments like hunting.
Scholars argue that it also is a political metaphor. For instance, the lion is a symbol of the strength of the Umayyad dynasty (above Abbasid).
This artifact can be understood as an invitation to take part in the great design of the dynasty. On the other hand, it reminds the prince how dangerous the power is.
