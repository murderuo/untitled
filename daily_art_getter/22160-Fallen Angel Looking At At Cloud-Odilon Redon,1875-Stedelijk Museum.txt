Odilon Redon born on this day in 1840 was French Symbolist painter, lithographer, and etcher of considerable poetic sensitivity and imagination, whose work developed along two divergent lines. His early works - mostly prints and drawings (go to our archive to see more!) explore haunted, fantastic, often macabre themes and foreshadowed the Surrealist and Dadaist movements. Redon's works from this period were described as "a synthesis of nightmares and dreams", as they contained dark, fantastical figures from the artist's own imagination. His work represents an exploration of his internal feelings and psyche. He himself wanted to place "the logic of the visible at the service of the invisible".
Later in his life he turned to color - and then Redon had a keen interest in Hindu and Buddhist religion and culture. The figure of the Buddha increasingly showed in his work. Also influences of Japonism blended into his art. But Redon was also interested in Christian art - today's Angel is a good example of that.
