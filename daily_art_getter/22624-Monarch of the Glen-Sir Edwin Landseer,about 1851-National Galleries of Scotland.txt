The Monarch of the Glen is one of the most famous British pictures of the 19th century; for many people it encapsulates the grandeur and majesty of Scotland’s highlands and wildlife. Here Landseer depicts a monumental and precisely defined royal or twelve-point stag, a reference to the number of points on its antlers. Many of his paintings show interactions between humans and animals, but in this, his most well-known work, a single emblematic creature is viewed in a moment of exhilaration.
It became widely admired in the 19th century, when it was reproduced in prints, and achieved even greater renown in the 20th century when it was employed as a marketing image for various products, endowing it with global recognition.
