According to the Chinese zodiac, 2019 is the year closing the twelve-year lunar calendar cycle. Itâ€™s named after the Pig because according to the mythology, it was the last guest to arrive when the Jade Emperor (the first god) or Buddha (depending on the source) called for the great meeting.
A pig represents luck, overall good fortune, wealth, honesty, and general prosperity, symbolizing a hard working, peace-loving, truthful, generous, indulgent, patient, reliable, trusting, sincere, giving, and sociable person with a large sense of humor and understanding.
On this occasion, we present to you a Sleeping pig, by James Ward, R.A., who was a painter (particularly of animals) and an engraver.
Xin nian yu kuai!
