He returned to America as a full-fledged "impressionist" and proceeded to receive acclaim for his city street scenes and American flag series. Hassam exhibited in the prestigious Armory Show of 1913, but eventually became a member of The Ten, a group of artists who refused to exhibit in juried exhibitions.
