This Roman fresco is very mysterious. It was painted on the wall of grand triclinium, a formal dining room, which was one of the most important rooms in Roman villas. It shows a standing woman holding a shield: she is probably a seer predicting the birth of a male heir and future king. The image of a nude man wearing the white band that served as crown for Hellenistic rulers appears as a reflection in her shield.
