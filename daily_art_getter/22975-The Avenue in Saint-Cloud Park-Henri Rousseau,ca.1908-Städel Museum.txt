At the age of 41, Henri Rousseau gave up his work as a customs official to devote himself entirely to painting. A self-taught artist, he developed a style characterized by distortions and unnatural proportions and perspectives. Tiny human figures promenade along an avenue lined with rows of uniform trees. In naïve manner, every detail, whether in the foreground or background, is treated equally. Rousseau is considered a precursor of Surrealism because of the way dream worlds and reality merge in his works.
We present today's work thanks to Städel Museum. Their collection is amazing, don't forget to check it out.
