It is a little-known fact that in the 19th century Rembrandt was an icon for numerous French avant-garde artists, including Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. Great names such as Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Odilon Redon, and Theodore Rousseau took Rembrandt and his work as their example. To them he was an anti-academic cult figure, an artist who shrugged off academic rules and captured the world around him with a fearless immediacy. Many French artists decided to start etching, as Rembrandt had, and there was a revival of the art form.
Until January 6, 2019, in The Rembrandt House Museum, you can see the exhibition Rembrandt in Paris: Manet, Méryon, Degas and the Rediscovery of Etching (1830-90). You can see today's masterpiece there. :)
Honfleur, a port in Normandy, was a popular place for many Impressionists. They formed the Honfleur School, whose members included Manet and Guérard. Guérard taught Manet to etch. Conversely, Manet's painted harbor scenes were a source of inspiration for this work by Guérard.
In this moonlit scene Guérard used a skilfully muted palette to capture the nocturnal atmosphere. He laid the composition in sketchily, in large areas. Guérard wanted to etch in this same direct style.
