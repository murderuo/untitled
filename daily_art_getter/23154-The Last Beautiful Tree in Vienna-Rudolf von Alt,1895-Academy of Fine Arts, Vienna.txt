We present todays watercolor thanks to Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna. Influence of international art movements (like French Impressionism) on Austrian art of the 19th century can be noticed in the collection of the Graphic Collection of the Academy, such as in this work by Rudolf von Alt. 
The last beautiful tree in Vienna was done in 1895. Based on this piece, you can observe von Alt's mastery of watercolor. Through his lifetime he created more than 1,000 watercolors that capture the Austria of that time, both landscape and architecture, topographically accurate and atmospheric.
Rudolf von Alt was born in 1812 in the former Viennese suburb of Alservorstadt and studied at the Vienna Academy from 1825 to 1832; later he was appointed an honorary member. He undertook study tours throughout Europe, became one of the most popular artists of 19th century Austria, and was one of the founding members of the Vienna Secession in 1897.
P.S. Everybody knows The Kiss of another great Viennese artist, Gustav Klimt, but he also painted beautiful landscapes and you can see these gems here. <3
