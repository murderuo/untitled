In 1883, Homer witnessed an event near Atlantic City, New Jersey, that allegedly inspired this dramatic painting. Rescuers try to haul ashore two women, weighed down by their waterlogged bathing dresses, in danger of being pulled beneath the waves by an undertow. The figures appear as three-dimensional and solid as the ancient Greek marble statues on which they were modeled. Yet despite their muscularity and apparent strength, their struggle suggests human frailty in the face of the sea’s awesome power.
We present today's painting thanks to The Clark :)
BTW. - Don't forget that today's is Museum Selfie Day! Take some good photos! :)
P.S. Read about Elizabeth Nourse, “unquestionably the premier woman artiste of America” here.
