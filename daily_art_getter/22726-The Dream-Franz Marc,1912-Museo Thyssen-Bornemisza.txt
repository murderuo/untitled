In this piece, Franz Marc provides a mixture of Italian Futurist and French Cubist theories. The composition is structured around dynamic lines radiating outwards from the female figure in the foreground; naked and asleep, she becomes a symbol of the harmony between the human world and the animal realm. In his paintings, the colors had their symbolic meanings—blue, for example, represents what is masculine and intellectual, while yellow symbolizes femininity and warmth. The whole scene seems to be a dream of the female figure.
I love that cat-like looking animal on the left!
