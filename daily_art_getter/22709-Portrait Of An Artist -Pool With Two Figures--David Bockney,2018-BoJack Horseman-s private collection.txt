Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) is a classical piece of art by David Bockney representing the symbolic hell of interpersonal relations. The painting shows a pool on a luxurious estate in Los Angeles and the drama of a split couple. The swimming figure - the artist himself - tries to understand what ended this relationship which could not have been saved by any amount of money, career or hysterical effort. The emptiness in the eyes of his former partner is like a stare into the abyss, the forthcoming epilogue of the relationship. His red jacket is like the armor in which he has hidden himself mentally and emotionally.
The painting hangs in Los Angeles, in the office of a celebrity of the popular 90s sitcom - BoJack Horseman. There, it has witnessed scenes adequate for a good picture comedy-drama series: wild orgies, all-night parties, all manner of grotesque behavior. Despite the sad tone of this piece of art, thanks to its reference to two topos: cleansing and initiation, the introduction to maturity, Bockney gives us and its owner a glimmer of hope, symbolized in the crystal clear water of the pool and the warm California sun. If the swimmer is able to get out of the water and face his own ego, he will become a true man. However, until he makes this move, we only see the status quo: the pain and the obsessive struggle of an artist with himself alone, which is bound to fail.
BoJack Horseman is my favorite show, full of references to art history (you can read about all of them in our article ALL Art In BoJack Horseman We Could Find Gathered In One Place). I hope you don’t mind that we’ve featured this painting today, on the date of the 5th season premiere. You know, it helps us to translate the app into new languages, develop new features… see you tomorrow! :)Zuzanna
