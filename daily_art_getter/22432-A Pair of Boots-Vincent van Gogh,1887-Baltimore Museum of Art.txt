Early in 1886, van Gogh arrived in Paris, where he encountered the work of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, and shortly thereafter abandoned the dark palette that had marked his earlier works. The paintings he produced during his two-year stay in the city ranged in subject matter from landscapes to portraits, figure studies, and still lifes. Within the latter genre are floral pieces, arrangements of books and various fruits, and a series of remarkably expressive representations of workingmen’s boots. In this poignant image, a pair of worn boots has been carefully arranged on blue fabric. Although still somewhat dark in tonality, the painting demonstrates van Gogh’s transition to lighter colors, which reached fruition following his move to Arles in February 1888.
We present today's painting thanks to Baltimore Museum of Art :)
