This year we celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Jewish Historical Institute. It is one of the most important research institutes in the field of Polish Jews’ history. The Institute is located in the building at 3/5 TLomackie Street in Warsaw (Poland), where the Main Judaic Library was established before World War II.
"To paint was her only desire"—this is how Józef Sandel, a post-war curator of the art department of the Jewish Historical Institute, described Gela Seksztajn. These words reflect the character of her passionate work. Her path to become a painter was not easy. As a child of a working-class family Gela did not have many opportunities to study painting, but her strong will, determined pursuit of purpose, and unquestionable talent enabled her to succeed. Gela’s favorite subjects were children. Thanks to her, many portraits of young ghetto inhabitants have been preserved. Her flourishing painting career was interrupted by the war, yet even difficult conditions did not stop her from acting. As a teacher, she tried to bring at least some joy to the lives of her children. Gela Seksztajn died with her daughter and her husband in Warsaw, probably in 1943. Her works survived thanks to the Ringelblum Archive created by the Oneg Shabbat—the Underground Archive of the Warsaw Ghetto. Gela’s works, along with the entire Ringelblum Archive, have been listed on UNESCO’s Memory of the World International Register.
The surviving works of Gela Seksztajn can be seen on Delet portal.
