Not only is Käthe Kollwitz one of the best-known modern women artists in Germany, she is also one of the most famous pioneers of her profession. In 1919 she became the first female member of the Berlin Academy of Arts and at the same time was the first woman to receive the title of professor. She achieved her breakthrough with the printed cycle ›The Weavers’ Revolt‹, which she showed at the Great Berlin Art Exhibition in 1898. At that time, the emperor refused to award her a prize because ›a medal for a woman, that would be going too far‹. After studying in the sculpture class of the Académie Julian and visiting Auguste Rodin, she increasingly devoted herself to sculpture.
We present today's painting thanks to Nationalgalerie Berlin, where until March 8th you can visit the exhibition "Fighting for VisibilityWomen Artists in the Nationalgalerie before 1919". And if you would like to see more women artists but you can't go to Berlin be prepared - in DailyArt app and in DailyArt Magazine we announce Match to be the Women Artists Month. It means we will feature a looooot of women artists :) Enjoy!
