Today is International Women's Day :) On this occasion we have for you a masterpiece created by a very interesting female artist—Tamara de Lempicka. Enjoy and please note that this month we also celebrate Women's History Month and you should check out our Instagram account. :)
Perhaps Tamara De Lempicka’s most famous painting, Girl in Green with Gloves, has been an icon to her artistic style and work throughout her career. It shows a beautiful young woman wearing a flimsy green dress, white gloves, and a large, white hat. The sharp-edged form combined with the bold use of color render the whole strongly dimensional and modern. It appears that the sleek feminine figure with curvaceous lines is holding on to her hat in order to avoid losing it in the breeze, De Lempicka undoubtedly masters the effect of a wind blowing through the painting. A slight sense of eroticism is established by having the dress cling to her body, revealing her breasts and navel through the fabric. It's a perfect example of the Art Deco style.
One of the most dominant figures of the Art Deco years, which peaked from 1925 to 1935, was Tamara De Lempicka. Her detailed portraits of many famous and successful celebrities brought her much fame and fortune before she left Paris and traveled to Hollywood, California. This move furthered her acclaim by making her the popular portrait artist of the stars. She also lived in New York and Houston before settling permanently in Mexico, where she died in 1980.To read more about the artist, check out this article "Tamara de Lempicka, The First Woman Artist To Be A Glamour Star" on DailyArt Magazine.
