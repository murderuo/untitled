Brothers Menasze and Efraim Seidenbeutel (1902, Warsaw - 1945, KL Flossenbürg) were two of the most important bohemian artists of interwar Poland. They were twins biologically as well as artistically. Their older brother was their first painting teacher. In 1921, they began studying painting and had their first exhibition. During the interwar years, the brothers were developing their artistic talent and participated in many exhibitions, both in Poland and abroad. During the occupation of Poland Menasze and Efraim were confined in the BiaLystok Ghetto. From there, they were deported to an extermination camp. They were murdered one day before the camp was liberated.
“They are […] painters. Twin brothers, a brotherly team. The similarity is uncanny. They paint together. One is better with form, the other with color.” Tadeusz Brzeza saw the differences in the brothers’ paintings, but seeing it today seems impossible. The Girl in a Green Dress was painted by Menasze in 1931 and is perhaps a testimony of the author’s fascination with the exotic beauty of the model whose identity remains unknown. It may have been inspired during one of his travels. The portrait was painted using mostly two colors, green and brown. The different hues create a soothing composition.
The works of the Seidenbeutel brothers can be viewed on the Delet portal.
