On this day in 1878 Kazimir Malevich, a pioneer of geometric abstract art and the originator of the avant-garde Suprematist movement was born.
Mystic Suprematism (Black Cross on Red Oval) shows Malevich's art at its most iconoclastic and theoretically complex. Painted in the early 1920s in the immediate aftermath of the Russian Revolution, the image here embodies the new world order promoted by the Suprematist movement, Malevich's radical artistic philosophy that transformed Russian avant-garde art in the early twentieth century.
Suprematist painting, Malevich explained, was a universal art that was immediately accessible, unmistakably clear, and supreme in its aesthetic intentions. "Color and texture in painting are ends in themselves," Malevich wrote in his 1915-16 treatise, The Suprematist Manifesto. "They are the essence of painting, but this essence has always been destroyed by the subject." Suprematism was rooted in Malevich's desire to move beyond traditional representation towards an art of pure color and geometric form. While this radical idea had its origins in Cubism and Futurism, Suprematism proposed something wholly new in that it rejected any subjective basis or thematic origin.
It's a movement with some difficult assumptions but it's worth exploring! Read more aboutÂ it in the article "Everything You Must Know About Suprematism and Kazimir Malevich" on DailyArt Magazine.
