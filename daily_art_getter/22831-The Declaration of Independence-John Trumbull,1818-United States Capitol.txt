This painting is significant to American art because it represents an important moment in national history—the creation of the Declaration of Independence. This was the document that delegates from the 13 American colonies (then part of Great Britain) wrote, signed, and sent to King George III in 1776 to inform him that they were breaking away. The Declaration started the American Revolution and led to the creation of the United States of America.
Many people assume that this painting depicts the famous event on July 4, 1776, when delegates signed the Declaration of Independence, but this isn’t true. It actually shows the presentation of the Declaration to the Continental Congress responsible for creating it, a moment that took place about a week earlier. The five men responsible for writing the Declaration, including future President Thomas Jefferson and statesman Benjamin Franklin, are the central group shown in the painting, and Continental Congress President John Hancock appears seated in front of them. The artist, John Trumbull, visited these men and many of the others depicted to paint them as accurately as possible. Interestingly, not all the delegates in the painting were actually present at the moment in question, but Trumbull felt that it was important to include them in honor of their contributions.Trumbull hoped that his many paintings of the American Revolution would stimulate an American interest in history painting to parallel what already existed in Europe. This wasn’t to be the case and history painting never became popular in the United States. Trumbull received a commission to paint this and other scenes from the Revolution, however, to decorate the new U.S. Capitol building. The smaller, original version of this painting that Trumbull used to secure the commission is now at the Yale University Art Gallery.
