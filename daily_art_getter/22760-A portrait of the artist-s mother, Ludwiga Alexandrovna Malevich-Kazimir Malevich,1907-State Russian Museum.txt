Today thanks to State Russian Museum we present a portrait of the Kazimir Malevich's mother, Ludwiga Alexandrovna Malevich. I love this drawing!
Parents of the future artist were descendants from Poland. Kazimir was their first child. Ludwiga Alexandrovna ran the household and raised nine children. As the Kazimir’s daughter Una Malevich recollected, grandma Ludwiga was a creative person: she wrote poems in Polish, embroidered, knitted and wove lace. It was she who gave her son the first set of colors. Kazimir Malevich created in oil several portraits of his mother in the early 1930s.
