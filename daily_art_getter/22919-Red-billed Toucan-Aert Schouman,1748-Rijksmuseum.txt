As you may know, we love to feature all kinds of animals in DailyArt. Preferably cats, but a toucan would be fine for today! ;)
The Dordrecht artist Aert Schouman was no scientist. He was a prolific and versatile Dutch painter, glass engraver, printmaker, collector, and dealer, who produced still lifes, biblical and mythological themes, natural history studies, genre, historical and topographical works, portraits, sketches, etchings, and mezzotints. But he was deeply interested in true-to-life depictions of the bird realm. His keen powers of observation are demonstrated by the way in which this red-billed toucan grasps the branch, namely with two, rather than three toes like other species. The landscape airily painted in transparent shades of green and blue evokes the birdâ€™s native regions in Guyana and North Brazil.
 P.S. I think all kind of creatures can be found in art. See our selection of spiders here. :)
