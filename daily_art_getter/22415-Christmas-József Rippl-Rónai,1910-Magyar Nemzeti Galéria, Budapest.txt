Merry Christmas and may you live a long and happy life filled with goodwill and friendship :)) We hope you're having a calm, marvellous time!
Christmas shows a complete interior with objects special for the artist, József Rippl-Rónai. Dark patches of the picture and human figures recall his French black period. The figure of the old woman is a serious element of the composition as dark patches are important from the point of view rhythm. Rippl was fascinated by the effect of blacks and bright colors. The decorative lively green Christmas tree, the furniture, and the Christmas decorations flash up to soften the seriousness of the composition and reflect the atmosphere of Christmas.
