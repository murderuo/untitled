Today is another Sunday with The Clark's collection of Renoir paintings. Never enough of Renoir! Enjoy! :)
Renoir painted this work while traveling in Italy; the model is probably Aline Charigot, who later became his wife. The simplicity of the composition gives the nude a monumental presence that suggests a timeless image of womanhood. Renoir was inspired in this approach by the ancient Roman and Italian Renaissance art he saw on his trip, which he described as representing “eternal beauty.”
More Renoir? Here we go!
