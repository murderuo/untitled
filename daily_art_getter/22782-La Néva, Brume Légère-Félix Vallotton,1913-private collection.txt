On this day in 1865 one of my favorite painters, Félix Vallotton, was born. I hope you will enjoy this very climatic landscape. :)
In 1913, Félix Vallotton travelled to Russia, visiting Moscow and Saint Petersburg. His journey yielded a series of paintings, completed upon his return, examples of which are rarely seen on the market. They include a group of works depicting the area surrounding the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, among them La Néva, brume légère (1913).
This painting is illustrated in all of the major literature describing Vallotton’s work, and is presented as a reference. It is one of his most important works from this period and without a doubt, ranks among the painter’s masterpieces.
