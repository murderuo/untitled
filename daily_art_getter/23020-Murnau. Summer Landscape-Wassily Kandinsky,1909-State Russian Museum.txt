In autumn 1908, a new stage began in Kandinsky’s work. Together with Gabriele Münter, he lived in Murnau, in a small settlement in the Bavarian Alps, 50 kilometers from Munich, on the invitation of Alexej von Jawlensky and Marianne von Werefkin. The artist’s works from these years demonstrate his familiarity with the works of the French fauvists, which he saw not long before this time in Paris. Summer Landscape, like the others he painted in Murnau, is distinguished by the heightened activity of color that does not seek to resemble nature, but instead reflect the artist’s emotions. They correspond to the famous approximate volumes and contours that tend to be, if not fully independent from the natural subject, largely free, that preceded the emergence of Kandinsky’s abstract compositions.
We present today's work thanks to the State Russian Museum.
