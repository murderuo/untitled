Today, after five years of renovation and rebuilding, Swedenâ€™s Nationalmuseum is open again to the public. Hipp Hipp Hurra! It's an important day for all art lovers! :) On this occasion, we present a piece from this marvellous collection. Enjoy! :)
Zorn worked primarily in watercolors during the 1880s. With virtuosity, he portrayed reflections and other light effects in images of everyday situations. The model here is Emma Lamm, who married Zorn in October 1885. The watercolor was painted the same year, quite possibly on their honeymoon, which took the couple via Vienna and Budapest to Constantinople. The viewer is looking up, at an angle, at Emma with the light behind her. The sun shines through her Japanese parasol with its painted decoration.
The museum house among others a collection of Carl Larsson's paintings. You can have a sneak peek in his Scandinavian living eternalized in paintings here!
