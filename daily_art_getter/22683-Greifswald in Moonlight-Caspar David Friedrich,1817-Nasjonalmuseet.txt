On this day in 1774, Caspar David Friedrich, a German Romantic landscape painter generally considered the most important German artist of his generation, was born. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes that typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees, or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. 
Both Friedrich's life and art have at times been perceived by some art historians to have been marked with an overwhelming sense of loneliness. Maybe they are right. But for me, Friedrich was also an artist who was able to see things differently. Like today's Greifswald, which is normally just a town in Germany, but in this painting it looks like a mysterious kingdom from a fantastic world. For me, it even looks like one of the lands from Game of Thrones. :)
