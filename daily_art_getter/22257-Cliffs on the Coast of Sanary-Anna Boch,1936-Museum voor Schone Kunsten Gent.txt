Today it's time for another piece from the great collection from Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent. Enjoy :)A painting like Cliffs on the Coast of Sanary shows us that Anna Boch was very much influenced by French Impressionist painters such as Claude Monet. As a member of the Les XX group of artists in Brussels, she was close to the avant-garde both as a painter and a collector. She came from a wealthy artistic family and used her fortune to help artists who exhibited their work together with her at Les XX. Boch was one of the earliest collectors of modernist art in the 1880s and owned works by such artists as James Ensor, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat, Paul Signac, and Vincent van Gogh.
