This lively masterpiece by Vitale da Bologna was painted in about 1353, in the tradition of the 14th century Italian gothic art. The Virgin is sitting next to her Child, behind them there are Saint Catherine of Alexandria and a crowned saint-martyr. The iconography of the Madonna of Humility was meant to give a domestic image of the Virgin, while the precious textiles suggest her majesty. It is a rare depiction of the Madonna of the embroidery—following a tradition, the Virgin used to earn her living spinning and embroidering while Christ (starting at age 5) helped.
As suggested by the critics this finely decorated panel reminds of a Persian miniature. Vitale shows the everyday life of the characters and the affection between the mother and her child.
We present today's masterpiece thanks to Museo Poldi Pezzoli in Milan <3
