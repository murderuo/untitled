Graham's observations of fleeting effects in nature provided the basis for his painting. He captured the transient character of clouds as they float around the mountain tops and descend into the valleys, and recorded their wandering shadows across the slopes. The sense of movement and constant change is echoed in the mountain stream flowing down to the gushing river. One knows too that the presence of the fisherman and sheep, which emphasizes the vastness of the rocky terrain, is also temporary. On moving to London, Graham produced a series of grand paintings like this, particularly appealing to an urban-based audience.
We present this haunting work thanks to the National Galleries of Scotland. I wish I could visit that place from the painting!
