When the North Sea Canal was finished in 1876, the Amsterdam IJ became navigable for large oceanliners. New streets with warehouses – such as the Van Die-menstraat seen in this painting – were built along the banks of the canal. Breitner depicted construction workers on their lunch break, seen from the back. They are painted with the same rough, angular volumes as the planks on which they sit and the tents and sails in the background.
This artwork is featured as a part of our collaboration with Europeana, Europe’s platform for cultural heritage. Their project Europe at Work shares the story of Europe through our working lives in the past and the present.
P.S. If you felt hungry or thirsty after seeing this painting, we have a selection of coffee, tea and beer here. Drinks in the art for all tastes!
