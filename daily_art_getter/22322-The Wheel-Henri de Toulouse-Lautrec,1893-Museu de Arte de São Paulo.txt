It's time for our monthly feature—in September we are presenting pieces of Toulouse-Lautrec from the Toulouse-Lautrec in Red exhibition, which is now on view at the Museu de Arte de São Paulo. You can visit it until October 1st, so if you would like to visit it, you should be quick! :)
In The Wheel, Toulouse-Lautrec portrays a cabaret performance in an unusual way, built from the viewpoint behind the scenes, revealing a complicity between the painter and the cabaret world. It is interesting to note that the painting suggests a kind of game, as if the spectator waited his turn to enter the stage. It is not known who the woman is, but Toulouse-Lautrec dedicated this work to another dancer, very famous at the time, the American Loïe Fuller (1862–1928).
