Until January 6, 2019, in The Rembrandt House Museum, you can see the exhibition Rembrandt in Paris: Manet, Méryon, Degas and the Rediscovery of Etching (1830-90). You can see today's masterpiece there. :)
This ode to the beauty of the Dutch landscape is the largest landscape print Rembrandt made. It is a dramatic depiction of nature, with painterly effects on the border between light and shade. Exhibited in the Louvre from the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was the French avant-garde artists’ favourite print.
See you tomorrow guys!
P.S. Read about Rembrandt and his saddest love story.
