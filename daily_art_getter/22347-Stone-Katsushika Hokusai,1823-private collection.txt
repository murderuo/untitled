On this day in 1760, Hokusai, one of the most famous Japanese artists, ukiyo-e painter, and printmaker of the Edo period was born. We couldn't not feature one of his woodblock prints today—it is a less known piece, but how beautiful!
Stone (Ishi) is from the series Osana asobi ken sanbantsuki no uchi. The woman in this exquisitely printed surimono is painting the flat surface of a tray landscape, made with a mountain-shaped stone. A painting hangs in the alcove beside her. The subject of the painting in the alcove is Huang Chuping, a Daoist adept who began his life as a goatherd. Aged fifteen, he found a cave and spent the next forty years there in meditation. When he emerged, he found that his goats had turned into blocks of stone. This not only illustrates the subject of stone but also indicated that the print was published in the spring of 1823, a Goat Year.
