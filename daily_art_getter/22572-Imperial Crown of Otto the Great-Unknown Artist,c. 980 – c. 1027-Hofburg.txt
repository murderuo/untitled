This remarkable crown is one of a few pieces of medieval art featuring an unusual design and an equally unusual history. Although the crown was originally attributed to Holy Roman Emperor Otto the Great (r. 962-973), the remaining features of its original design indicate that it could have been made for and used by any of the late 10th century rulers of this region. This medieval crown was used in the coronation ceremonies of Holy Roman Emperors for centuries, beginning in the 10th or 11th century through the early 19th century, when the Holy Roman Empire was formally dissolved.
Unlike many crowns, this crown is octagonal; there are eight separate plates made of gold that are fixed together in an alternating pattern. Four of the plates feature cloisonn√© enamel Biblical scenes emphasizing kings and their divine right to rule: King David, King Solomon, King Ezechias and Isaiah, and Christ enthroned. A total of 144 precious stones, including sapphires, emeralds, amethysts, and pearls, decorate all the panels of the crown, although the feature stone at the front, originally an opal nicknamed the Waise, was removed and replaced, disappearing entirely from the record by about 1350. Several other features of this crown were also later additions, including the arch connecting the front and back plates, which was added by Emperor Conrad II (r. 1024-1039), and the cross at the front.
The Holy Roman Empire existed for nearly a thousand years, and the continued use of this medieval crown by its many emperors demonstrates the premium they placed on their connections to an increasingly distant past.
