We continue our special month with the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden's collection.  Today is a contemporary art classic.  : ) Enjoy!
Gerhard Richter has always used photographic motifs as an important source for his painting. In STRIP (927-9) from 2012, the hierarchy between the two media was reversed. The painting Abstract Picture (924-4), created as early as 1990, is the source material for STRIP (927-9), which was created as a digital expression of a motif generated in the computer. Its structure and coloring are derived from the color composition of the abstract image. The work process, however, has transformed the motif into a completely independent composition. For this purpose, the artist first photographed the painting. Using a computer program, he divided, mirrored, and repeated the abstract motif several times. The motif was broken down into ever narrower vertical segments and then stretched out by axis mirroring. The results represent a combination of the unpredictable, seemingly random stripes found in a determined process and Richter's ordering figure.
