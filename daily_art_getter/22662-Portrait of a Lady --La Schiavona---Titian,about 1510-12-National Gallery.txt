Titian was the greatest painter of 16th-century Venice and the first painter to have a mainly international clientele. During his long career, he experimented with many different styles of painting that embody the development of art during his epoch.
The painting, known by the 17th century as La Schiavona (the Dalmatian woman), must date from 1510-1512. The initials T.V. on the parapet probably stand for Tiziano Vecellio. The raised portion of the parapet is a revision, and drapery originally painted there now shows through it. The profile relief, inspired by those on antique cameos, seems to be of the same sitter.Here you can read about another painting of this infamous painter - Sacred and Profane Love.
