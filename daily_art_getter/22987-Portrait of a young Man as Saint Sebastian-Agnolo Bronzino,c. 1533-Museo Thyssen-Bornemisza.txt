Saint Sebastian here is portrayed not bleeding from his wounds, but more in the manner of a god of classical mythology or a young, slender Apollo. He is identified by the arrow which he holds in his hand and by the second arrow which cleanly penetrates his side without drawing blood.
Agnolo di Cosimo di Mariano Tori, known as Bronzino, was one of the leading artists of Florentine Mannerism. Born in Monticelli near Florence, he began his studies with Raffaellino del Garbo. He was a student at Pontormo’s studio, which would be fundamental for his subsequent development. Bronzino worked with Pontormo on the fresco decoration of the Chapterhouse at Galluzzo, which Vasari stated to be his first project. They later worked together in Florence, where Bronzino assisted his teacher in the Capponi chapel in Santa Felicità between 1526 and 1528. The first works attributed to the artist are closely related to Pontormo’s style and some have been attributed to the latter, indicating the degree to which Bronzino assimilated his master’s approach.
P.S. Why is St Sebastian a gay icon?
