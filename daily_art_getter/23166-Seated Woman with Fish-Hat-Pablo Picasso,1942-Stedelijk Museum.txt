The seated woman posing with a fish hat in this painting is depicted in Picasso’s trademark, spatially ambitious style in which the woman’s face appears both frontally and in profile. But what is it about? Was it a joke about some acquaintance? The painting was painted midway through the World War II. Picasso stayed in Paris during the entire Nazi occupation. He did not bother to exhibit his work at this time, but he never stopped creating. Was he making fun of women’s frivolous fashions during wartime?
You must be a genius to paint a woman with fish-hat, this is my opinion. It's also one of my favorite Picasso paintings. 
This painting can be seen in the Stedelijk's latest exhibition:  Chagall, Picasso, Mondrian and Others: Migrant Artists in Paris. It presents art from the superb collection of the Stedelijk Museum, and includes work by more than 50 artists, photographers, and graphic designers. The show ends on 2 February 2020; don't miss it!
See you tomorrow! And in the meantime read about Picasso and his women here.
