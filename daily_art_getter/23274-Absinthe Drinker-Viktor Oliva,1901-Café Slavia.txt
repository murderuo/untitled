Today marks National Absinthe Day celebrating the distilled, licorice-flavored, botanical spirit. This potent alcoholic beverage originated in Switzerland and became particularly popular in France in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Absinthe drinkers were the subject of paintings by Manet, Degas, and Picasso among others. In this compelling piece by Czech painter Victor Oliva, the patron in the cafe, a weary middle-aged man with glazed eyes, has an unusual companion: a nude woman - translucent green like his drink - perched seductively on the edge of the table. Nicknamed “the green fairy”, absinthe was originally believed to have addictive and hallucinogenic properties. It's no wonder the man has conjured this temptress. Worth noting is that the scene is likely set in Café Slavia, one of Prague's oldest coffee houses. A historically popular meeting place for poets, artists, and other intellectuals, it was frequented by Oliva. Absinthe Drinker, Oliva's most famous work, hangs in the famed café.
