Have you ever been to Ghent to see museum collections there? No? Unfortunately we didn't either but we have prepared something special for you. Today we start our new monthly special feature. For the next four Sundays we will be presenting pieces from the collection of Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent. :) Enjoy!
Marguerite Van Mons stares at her spectators with a wistful, distant look. Théo Van Rysselberghe painted the young girls portrait soon after the death of her mother. The sombreness of the dress is in sharp contrast with her pale face and the delicate blue of the door panel with gilded profiles. The girl is depicted in full frontal stance with her back against the door. Her right hand is holding onto the doorknob, as if she has just entered the room or is just about to leave. It is this ambiguous gesture, and the general air of melancholy, that give this picture its symbolic character. The influence of James Abbott McNeill Whistlers portrait skills is clearly noticeable. Van Rysselberghe became familiar with his oeuvre at the Les Vingt salons. The painter dedicated the portrait to Emile Van Mons, Marguerites father.
