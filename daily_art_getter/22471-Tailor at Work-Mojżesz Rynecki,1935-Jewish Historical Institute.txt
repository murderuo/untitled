Mojżesz (Moshe) Rynecki (b. Siedlce 1881 – d. Majdanek 1943) was born in a moderately wealthy orthodox family. He was taught painting privately by artist Ignacy Gajewski in Siedlce, and later studied at the School of Fine Arts in Warsaw (1906-1907). Rynecki’s watercolors and drawings show the multifaceted image of life in the poor Jewish districts in Warsaw. He mostly portrayed scenes of labor.
Rynecki’s watercolors are based on a realistic drawing base, animated with vivid colors. First, Rynecki used flat color patches, only later did he start painting with rapid, winding brushstrokes. He positioned elaborate group compositions in a narrowly cropped frame. Rynecki did not paint his characters with individual facial features, which gives them a somewhat caricatured appearance. An example of this tendency is the Tailor at Work.
The works of Mojżesz Rynecki the can be viewed on the Delet portal.
