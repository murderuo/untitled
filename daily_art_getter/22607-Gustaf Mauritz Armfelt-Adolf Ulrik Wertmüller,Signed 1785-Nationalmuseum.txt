Gustav Mauritz Armfelt was one of the favorites of King Gustav III of Sweden. Today we may not associate his androgynous appearance with power and social influence, but for Armfelt's contemporaries this is what his appearance represented. The face of power changes throughout history and is closely related to notions of gender.  Once again we feature a piece connected to #PrideMonth. :) We present today's piece thanks to Nationalmuseum in Stockholm.
