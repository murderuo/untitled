Women are often erased from art history, where it takes some digging to find the famous female painters that have changed, inspired, and pushed the art world forward while they were alive. In order to celebrate these artists, in DailyArt app and DailyArt Magazine this month will be devoted to them.  Enjoy!:)
Judith Jans Leyster was a Dutch Golden Age painter. She painted genre works, portraits and still lifes. Although her work was highly regarded by her contemporaries, Leyster and her work became almost forgotten after her death. Her entire oeuvre was attributed to Frans Hals or to her husband, Jan Miense Molenaer, until 1893. The singing lute-player is depicted di sotto in su, from a low vantage point. His extravagant red breeches with yellowish-gold and black stripes are slightly out of focus, creating the illusion that the viewer is looking up at him from close by.
See you tomorrow!
P.S. In Berlin you can still visit the exhibition showing exclusively women's art called 'Fighting for Visibility'. Read more about it here.
