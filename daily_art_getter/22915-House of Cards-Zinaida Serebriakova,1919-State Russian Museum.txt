As we are preparing ourselves for launching the Russian version of DailyArt (!), it is time for some Russian art from The State Russian Museum.  :)
Remember Zinaida Serebryakova? We featured a couple of her works in March (you can see them in the Archive). The life-asserting power and beauty of images created by her ascend to the best traditions of Russian and West European realistic art. The year 1919, when Serebryakova painted House of Cards was tragic for Serebryakova's family. Her husband Boris died of typhus, her estate in Neskuchnoye was plundered, and the artist remained with her sick mother and four children without any means of livelihood. It was during this period, however, that she created one of her best paintings, a picture imbued with uncertainty in the future, and at the same time filled with light and the tenderness of a mother's love. The painting depicts the children of Zinaida Serebryakova—Eugene, Alexander, Tatiana, and Catherine.
See you tomorrow!
P.S. For more artists’ children depictions by their mothers, read Candy's article here.
