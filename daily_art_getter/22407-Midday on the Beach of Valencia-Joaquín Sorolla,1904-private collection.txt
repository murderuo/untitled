If you are in one of those cold places (like Poland now), I hope this painting, which we feature today thanks to Museo Sorolla, will warm your heart. :)
In the summer of 1904, Sorolla paints some of his most famous works: Summer in the Museo de Bellas Artes in La Habana, The Boy with the Little Boat in the Museo Sorolla, and this Midday on the Beach of Valencia, a view against the sun where the extremely white light of Valencia turns the sea to silver.
At the top of the painting a piece of the umbrella used by the painter to protect the canvas and his glance can be seen.
Sorolla’s vigorous brushstroke and the speed achieved by the master to carry out his paintings bring more modernity to this work where once again the light, the reflection, and the Mediterranean Sea are the absolute main characters of the painting.
