Look at this painting, the girls look like the twins in The Shining, maybe a bit less creepy, but the resemblance is visible! :)
According to family tradition, in the painting we see Amélie Florence Soulacroix, the artist’s daughter, with her unknown friend. Frédéric Soulacroix was a French painter who spent most of his life in Italy. Just like his father, the painter Charles Soulacroix, Frédéric specialised in 18th century genre painting and often depicted lavishly dressed subjects in scenes of gallantry or flirtation. Soulacroix was particularly skilled in the representation of fabric, as we can see in the present work. The girls wear beautiful, embellished dresses and stand in front of large silk curtains that are painted with such talent that they almost look real.
Come and play with us, Danny...
P.S. For more seriously creepy stuff check the deadly Sarmatians and their coffin portraits :D
