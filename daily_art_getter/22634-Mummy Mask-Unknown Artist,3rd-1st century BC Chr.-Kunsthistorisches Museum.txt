Oh my, I love mummies so much! We present today's mask thanks to our favoriteÂ  Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. :)
In the Ptolemaic period, the mummy was not surrounded by a complete mummy envelope, but only by individual covering pieces, including a mummy mask. The cardboard mask consists of three layers of canvas that have been moulded over a model and glued together. An inside and outside fine stucco layer served as a base and as a base for gold leaf overlays. The rich gilding on the face and in the three-part black and gold wreath wig suggests that the dead must have been a wealthy person. The gilding of the face also symbolizes the union of the dead with the sun god.Here you can read about other burial phenomena from Ancient Egypt - the Fayum Portraits!
