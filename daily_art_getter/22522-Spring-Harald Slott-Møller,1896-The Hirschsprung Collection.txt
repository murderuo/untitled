Harald Slott-MÃ¸ller (1864-1937) was inspired by the English Pre-Raphaelites and their idealistic art.
In Spring, the key concepts of germination and growth are symbolized by the young girl's oblivious world in which pure innocence is still intact. As she sits by the roadside in heir flower-strewn dress and a halo of primroses in her hair, she is an emblem of the coming of spring.
The painting has an interesting interplay between the many naturalistic details and the ornamental quality of the picture as a whole. For example, the backdrop of the fjord landscape with its farms, ploughing horses, and village church stands in contrast to the birds forming an almost symmetrical pattern in the pussy willows, creating an ornamental framework around the girl. The theme is further emphasized by the decorated frame with its enamel violets and budding plant life.
We present today's painting thanks to Hirschsprung Museum!
