Happy International Women's Day!
Promoting Women Artists was always an idea very close to our hearts, so please note that March in DailyArt app and in DailyArt Magazine will be a month full of women artists - these recognized and widely admired, as well as these less known. Enjoy :)
During her early Impressionist period, Mary Cassatt frequently captured the activities of middle- and upper-class women in society—at the theater or taking tea, for example. On a Balcony, which was shown in the 1880 Impressionist exhibition, appears to depict a woman in a public setting. However, the blue rail of the balcony, visible near the top of the painting, defines the enclosed space of a private garden, and the woman’s morning dress further indicates the intimacy of her location. Cassatt signaled the modernity of her subject through the woman’s choice of reading material: she peruses a newspaper rather than a novel, demonstrating that even at home, Cassatt’s subjects are connected to the contemporary world.
P.S. Here's our Women’s Day message to all wonderful women! <3
