This carved ivory mirror case depicts a popular medieval allegory, called the Attack (or Siege) on the Castle of Love. It shows a group of knights trying to storm a castle. Normally in medieval warfare, people inside the castle would try to fend off these invaders. But that’s not what’s going on here, because this is love—not war.
Instead, the castle is filled with women who eagerly welcome the knights by throwing flowers. Two ladies have even lifted the gate and come out in greeting. The knights seem to be receptive to their advances. Some have abandoned their horses and climbed the castle walls to flirt with the ladies above. At the top of the castle is the person responsible for this strange occurrence: Cupid, who aims his arrows of love at the people below.
There are a few possible meanings here. One is that love makes people do foolish things. Another is that it takes a battle to win someone’s heart. Either way, it’s a memorable scene. It was common in medieval art and was sometimes performed as entertainment, too. Decorated cases like this one were popular in the Middle Ages. You might think of them as the designer iPhone cases of their time.
