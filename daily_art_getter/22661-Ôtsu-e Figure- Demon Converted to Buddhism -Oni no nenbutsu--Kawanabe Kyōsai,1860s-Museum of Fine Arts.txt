Ōtsu-e pictures were specialties of Ōtsu, the capital city of Shiga Prefecture in Japan. They were sold since the early Edo period at roadside stands as mementos for travelers along the Tokaido, the main highway between Kyoto and Edo (now Tokyo). At first, they mostly depicted religious themes. In the late Edo period, however, caricatures were its mainstream. This woodcut shows implicitly that a prayer to Buddha doesn't work without the true faith. ;)
I love this cat-like cute demon!Another genre popular in Japan was Shun-ga - erotic color woodblock prints. You can see them here.
