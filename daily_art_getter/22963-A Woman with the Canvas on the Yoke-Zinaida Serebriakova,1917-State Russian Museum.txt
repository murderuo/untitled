Remember Zinaida Serebriakova? We can't forget her works! We present today's painting thanks to The State Russian Museum. Enjoy! : )
A significant impact on the development of a great Russian female artist Zinaida Serebriakova’s style was provided by the Association World of Art, whose member she became in 1912. The late Art Nouveau and symbolism interact in the work of Serebriakova. Masters were united by the desire for aesthetic perfection, which they often found in female images. Zinaida saw a special beauty in Russian female peasants engaged in daily work. Women in her paintings are strong, tall, and full of strength and courage. The grace of their movements, special spirituality of faces—all these were conveyed in her works faithfully.
