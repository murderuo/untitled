We present today's painting thanks to Museo di Capodimonte in Naples (which has one of the biggest collection in Italy!), which was so kind to provide us with this beautiful Manneristic portrait from their collection. 
Antea (also known as Portrait of a Young Woman) is one example of the virtuosity and incredible optical painting skills of Francesco Mazzola, the so-called Parmigianino (Parma, 1503—Casalmaggiore, 1540).
The young woman, so enigmatic and elegant, dressed in such exquisite and aristocratic vests, seems to be standing still. In reality, however, she is turning, as suggested by the enlarged right sleeve and the line of the dress. Although nowadays we are not absolutely sure who the girl was, in the past she was recognized as Antea, a lady-in-waiting and Parmigianino’s love, while at the Roman court (1524-1527).
