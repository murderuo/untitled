Finnish artists had different views as to the questions arising from an industrializing society. Unlike Akseli Gallen-Kallela, a proponent of a mythical Finnish identity, Albert Edelfelt was a modern artist of his time, and the signs of the industrializing society can often be seen in the background of his works: modern ships and factory chimneys. This work places utility society, the raw materials of the wood processing industry, in the central role.
This artwork is featured as a part of our collaboration with Europeana, Europe’s platform for cultural heritage. Their Europe at Work project shares the story of Europe through our working lives in the past and the present.
