The name of Rembrandt’s mysterious masterpiece is not its original title—she is resting on a stone ledge, not a window. It comes from an anecdote recorded by one of its early owners, suggesting that the Dutch master had displayed the painting out of the window of his large house, and that the illusion was so convincing that passersby stopped to talk to her.
Girl at a Window has captivated viewers’ imaginations for centuries. Who could she be? Her arms, seemingly showing her perfect skin, up close reveal themselves to be tanned, and covered in red pockmarks; this suggests that she spends a lot of time outside. Her gaze seems to be directed at us, but is she looking right through us? The tiny flash of white on her nose, potentially the last mark of oil that Rembrandt left on the painting, brings his subject to life, as though she is about to snap out of her reverie and notice us, the viewer.
Girl at a Window is part of the Dulwich Picture Gallery’s collection. You can see it alongside other Rembrandt masterpieces in Rembrandt’s Light; a cinematic exploration of his works at the Dulwich Picture Gallery until 2 February 2020.
