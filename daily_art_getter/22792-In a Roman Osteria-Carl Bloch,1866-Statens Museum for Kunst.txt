Hope you're in a good mood after Christmas holidays and before the New Year! We present today's painting thanks to Statens Museum for Kunst - you can visit their new website to explore their amazing collection :)
In a Roman Osteria is an intensified version of a painting by one of Bloch’s major predecessors, Wilhelm Marstrand (1810-1873); specifically his charming Italian Osteria Scene from 1848 (Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek). It is one of Bloch’s most popular genre pictures and is typical of his seductive ability to depict objects, details, and clothes with striking realism. As is often the case in Bloch’s work, knives and forks are brandished rather freely. Note in particular how the phallic decanter to the left may be close to an inviting mouth with slightly parted lips, but is equally – and unpleasantly – close to a knife and a fork with only two large prongs considerably more pointy than those of the young man’s fork.
