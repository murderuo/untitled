We present today's unique piece thanks to Musée de Cluny, where until January 8th you can visit the Glass, The Inventive Middle Ages exhibition. We rarely feature such objects, so I hope you'll like it!
This painting-reliquary is exceptional for its double function and technical qualities. In 2016 it was acquired by the Musée de Cluny, National Museum of the Middle Ages, from private collections.
The enamelled plate represents Jesus Christ on the Cross whose thin and subtly engraved figure is somewhat reminiscent of the works of the prominent Parisian illuminator Jean Pucelle. The analogy, reflected in the extraordinary quality of the basse-taille technique and the plant motifs engraved beneath the blue enamel in the background, enables dating back to the mid-15th century. The relics of the True Cross and the Passion were probably kept in this reliquary, which suggests that the sponsor had connections with the royal environment. Besides its function as a reliquary, the painting measuring 17.5 x 12.8 cm (6.89″ x 5.04″) represents a unique vision of piety combining the Passion and Eucharist themes.
