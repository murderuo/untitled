Wassily Kandinsky was one of the pioneers who sought to penetrate the essence of art by abandoning the representation of visible reality. With visual elements pared down to their spiritual core, the Russian painter set out to penetrate the very soul of his audience in the way that music can. Inspired by his admiration for the spiritual power and abstract nature of music, Kandinsky gave his paintings titles derived from music, such as composition and improvisation. Improvisation 33 (Orient I) is one of his first abstract works. If you hold the preliminary studies beside the finished work, the shapes of a minaret, a fountain, and a woman can still be vaguely recognized.Here you can dive into the Kandinsky’s world of Russian fairy tales...
