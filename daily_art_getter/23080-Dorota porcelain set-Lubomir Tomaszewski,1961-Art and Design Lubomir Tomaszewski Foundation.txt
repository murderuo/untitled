This unique porcelain set was designed by Polish-American artist Lubomir Tomaszewski for Ćmielów Porcelain in 1961. He worked with the Ceramics and Glass studio of the Institute of Industrial Design in Warsaw, an innovative institution with the aim to design modern living in post-war Poland.
Dorota was an output of research Tomaszewski conducted to find new ergonomic forms. The designer noticed that cup and pot handles are prone to chipping and make storage of porcelain sets difficult. He decided to eliminate the need for handles by creating an extraordinary, sensual shape that was meant to be held in a hand. The artist named his work after one of his daughters.
The Dorota porcelain set received a gold medal at the Exhibition of the Board of the Industrial Designers’ Association in Paris in 1963. It is said that Rosenthal (the German porcelain factory) wanted to buy rights to mass produce Tomaszewski’s design, but due to political reasons the transaction didn’t happen. Disappointed, the artist emigrated to the USA and became a professor of industrial design at Bridgeport University. After he emigrated, Tomaszewski started to create his fire paintings and sculptures made in tune with nature. His porcelain set is a part of the permanent collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
