Renoir was an important figure in the 19th century Impressionist art movement. While studying at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, he met other influential artists such as Claude Monet, Frédéric Bazille, and Alfred Sisley, who eventually became key members of the movement. Around 1900 Renoir moved to the South of France to continue his artistic practices, although he had often visited the South during his lifetime. At this time his health was deteriorating with his arthritis becoming worse.
He settled in Cannes around 1902 where he painted many beach scenes similar to that depicted in St. Tropez. He adopted a more spontaneous style, using quick fluid brushstrokes to capture the bright, warm atmosphere of the south coast.
