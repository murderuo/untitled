I love moments when I work on DailyArt and can feature paintings I truly love! :) 
Thanks to the National Museum in Cracow we can show this masterpiece to you. If you happen to be in Cracow before July 2019, you can see this painting in the exhibition, Cracow 1900. 
WLadysLaw Ślewinski was one of the first Polish artists who went to study art not in Munich, like everyone in Poland then, but to Paris.
There, in 1888, in the studio of Philipp Colarossi or in the neighbouring restaurant Chez Madame Charlotte, Ślewinski met Paul Gauguin. This meeting and acquaintance, followed by a visit to Brittany where he joined the Pont Aven group, influenced Ślewinski's works. Based on synthetism, the artist developed his own way of imaging, and his calm, thoughtful and deeply reflective art, avoided literary symbolism.
Ślewinski painted Woman Combing her Hair in Paris in 1897. It is an intriguing and disturbing composition combining the Art Nouveau form with the young artist’s sensuality, unparalleled in other, usually restrained works by Ślewinski.
We do not know who the portrayed woman was. Perhaps it was the wife of the artist, Russian painter Eugenia Szewcow, who he met in Paris. Perhaps, as Antoni Potocki remarked, the woman portrayed in the painting is an unknown red-haired mermaid. Equally intriguing, next to the model is a mirror in which a face is reflected.Another Polish painting from that time which I truly like is Strange Garden. Have a look at it!
