The Graphic Collection of the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna owns one of the largest collections of drawings by Joseph Anton Koch (1768-1839). From October 4th, 2019 until January 12th, 2020 you can visit the exhibition: Drawings of Hell. The show focuses on the drawings of the Inferno of Dante Alighieri’s (1265-1321) Divine Comedy. Koch was one of the most profound connoisseurs of the Divina Commedia and was able to quote passages by heart. The presentation of 20 graphic works at the Academy also shows Koch’s typical impulsive use of the pen.
In this scene, Koch draws Dante and Virgil in a close-up view in front of the gate to hell. The inscription is shortened here to »LASCIATE / OGNI SPERANZA / VOI CH'ENTRATE« (“You who comes in, let drive any hope”). At the gate, three fleeing Damned appear with a huge flag and in the background, you can see Charon’s boat. In ancient mythology, he is the ferryman of the underworld and transports the deceased via the river Acheron to the island of the blessed. The desperate gesture of the Damned highlights the hopelessness of the Sinner doomed to hell.
P.S. One of the most famous depictions of Dante and Virgil in Hell is by William Bouguereau. Dark and disturbing... check it out!
