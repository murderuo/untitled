This is one of the early nude portraits that Félix Vallotton did in an interior, a theme that he would take up repeatedly until his death. In a clear composition and warm, harmonious tones, he shows the figure of a woman dressing, or rather undressing, in the light of day, her perfectly styled hair and her gaze directed towards a concealed door, causing us to suspect a secret love affair. But this picture lacks any anecdotal detail that would support this, so that we must assume that the bed and the scattered pieces of clothing are merely the artist’s excuse for staging the nude in the classic manner, from behind. 
I find Vallotton's interiors quite cinematic, as if they were stills from a movie. They look like Hopper's painting a little, don't they?
P.S. See one of our favorite paintings of Vallotton here!
