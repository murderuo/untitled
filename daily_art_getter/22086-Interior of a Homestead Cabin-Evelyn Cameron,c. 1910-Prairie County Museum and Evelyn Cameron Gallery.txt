When in 1868 Evelyn Jephson Flower was born in England it was with a silver spoon in her mouth. Born in a family of standing and considerable wealth, servants tended to her daily and ensured a life of comfort. She, however, had the spirit of an adventurer. She completely gave up privilege in England and entered a life of utmost hardship on the border of Montana (USA). There,she made friends with wolves and coyotes. Her spectacular photographs of hardship and endless barren lands were only discovered during the 1970's, together with her diary. They show the life of a frontier homestead in the toughest county in America:crystal clear depictions of poverty, friends, horses, wagons, trappers, and on goes the list.Thousands of prints were created in such a raw environment. This required a heavy camera that needed heavy support, chemistry, negatives and a horse to move it all across the harsh grounds. On top of that, she had married Ewen Somerled Cameron. Evelyn died in 1928, leaving a body of work that leaves a lasting impression. Most of which is now at the Montana Historical Society, Helena MT.- Erik
