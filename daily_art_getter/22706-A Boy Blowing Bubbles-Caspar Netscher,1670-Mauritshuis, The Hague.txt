We present today's paintings thanks to our favorite Mauritshuis from The Hague. :) Enjoy!
Caspar Netscher was a master at depicting fabrics and materials. He painted all the frills, ribbons, feathers, and curls in great details. The shiny soap bubbles in this little painting are remarkable.
A child blowing bubbles symbolized the transience of life. Soon, our lives will burst like a bubble. This message is made even more painful by the fact that the child in the painting is such a lively little chap.
See you tomorrow!
Here you will find a selection of awesome sweet littleÂ cupids! One of them is also blowing bubbles. We love bubbles, especially when they are marvellously painted by great masters!
