Did you know that 2019 is the year of Rembrandt? The artist died exactly 350 years ago—on this occasion in the Netherlands you can visit plenty of events devoted to him. 
We present today's painting thanks to our favorite Mauritshuis from the Hague where until September 15th you can visit Rembrandt and the Mauritshuis exhibition and see today's painting. :)
Joseph and Mary are in the temple to dedicate their newborn baby Jesus to God, where the child is recognized by Simeon as the long-awaited Messiah. The old man takes him in his arms and bursts into a song of praise. The divine light that floods Simeon appears to be shining from the child himself.
When Rembrandt painted this scene, he was 25 and still living in Leiden. He moved to Amsterdam in the same year, where he started to paint much larger works and made portraits for the first time.
P.S. Read about Rembrandt's saddest love story here.
