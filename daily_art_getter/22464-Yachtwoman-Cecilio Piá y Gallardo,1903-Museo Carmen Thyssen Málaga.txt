Have you ever heard about the author of this fantastic guache?
After studying at the craft school in Valencia in 1876, despite opposition from his father, he abandoned music for painting.
Extremely important among Plá's favorite themes were portraiture and genre painting, particularly with regard to family life. In this respect he was especially skilful at conveying a sense of harmony and tranquillity, as this delicate beach scene reveals. Pla painted numerous beach scenes, many small in size. His protagonists were usually members of the bourgeoisie at leisure, whom he sometimes depicted as boisterous, motley groups in the water, and on other occasions sitting with their backs to the spectator with the sea in the background. They all confirm one of the peculiarities of Cecilio Plá's works, however, his capacity to convey an aura of peace and happiness and a sense of tranquillity through pleasant, well-balanced scenes that effortlessly engage the spectator.
