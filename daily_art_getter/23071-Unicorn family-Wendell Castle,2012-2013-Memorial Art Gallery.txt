We are presenting this contemporary piece thanks to The Memorial Art Gallery, which commissioned this monumental cast-iron sculpture by Castle as one of the anchor installations of its Centennial Sculpture Park. Unicorn Family measures 22 feet in diameter and consists of a gathering area with a table and three chairs and a 13-foot LED lamp.
Wendell Castle (1932–2018) created unique pieces of handmade sculpture and furniture for over four decades. Since the outset of his career, Castle consistently challenged the traditional boundaries of functional design and established himself as the father of the American studio furniture movement. Castle was renowned for his superb craftsmanship, his whimsically organic forms, and his development of original techniques for shaping solid, stack-laminated wood.
Have a great Monday!  : )
