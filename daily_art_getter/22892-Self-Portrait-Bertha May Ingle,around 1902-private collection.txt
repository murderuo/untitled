Today is International Women's Day—we treat it as a part of Women's History Month and throughout March we will be focusing on female artists. Today we want to present this beautiful self-portrait of an artist, relatively unknown. Bertha May Ingle was a Canadian artist who lived most of her adult life in Toronto. She painted landscapes and portraits in an impressionist style, and had a special affinity for painting portraits of children. It's very difficult to find much info about her, the information available about her life is unfortunately very fragmentary. Although she labeled her photographs, she seldom labeled her paintings and drawings.
I love this self-portrait. :)  Please follow our Facebook, Instagram, and DailyArt Magazine.  We have prepared a lot of surprises regarding Women's History Month! :)
