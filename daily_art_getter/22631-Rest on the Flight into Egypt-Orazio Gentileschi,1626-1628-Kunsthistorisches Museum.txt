On the run from Herod, the Holy Family rests on the street, in front of a crumbling brick wall. Exhausted, Joseph has fallen asleep while Mary breastfeeds her child. In its depiction of misery as well as dignity, and humble acceptance of a hard fate, Gentileschi combines Caravaggian realism with the aesthetic sense of his Tuscan homeland.
We present today's painting thanks to Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna—one of my favorite European museums. <3As a bonus here are 5 weird portraits from Kunsthistorisches Museum. Enjoy!
