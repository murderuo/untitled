We can never have too much of Rembrandt! No 17th-century artist made as many self-portraits as Rembrandt did. This self-portrait dates from 1669, the year Rembrandt died, so it may be the last he painted. The expressive freedom of style shows that Rembrandt was certainly not exhausted at the end of his life. The way he painted the face with strong brushstrokes is remarkable. With thick layers of paint that are almost modelled, Rembrandt suggests a man of flesh and blood. This is a true masterpiece.
We present today's work thanks to our favorite Mauritshuis in the Hague.Â  : )

BTW. We would like to dedicate this DailyArt to one of our favorite authors - Simon Schama, who wrote an amazing book "Rembrandt's Eyes". We highly recommend it!
