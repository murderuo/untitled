This sketch presenting Rembrandt was created by his pupil, Willem Drost. Rembrandt had many pupils; some of them recorded his recollections in a comprehensive art theory treatise.
Van Hoogstraten described, for example, how on occasion in tears and without food or drink, he corrected the errors that Rembrandt had found in his work. He also recalled a discussion with Rembrandt in which his teacher ordered him not to keep coming up with new questions all the time, but for once to try to do what he had learned so far. The answers to other questions would then become clear to him as a matter of course. "If I ever bothered my master by asking too many different questions, he would answer, 'You just concentrate on learning to use what you already know in your work, and all in good time you’ll discover the hidden things you’re asking about now.’"
Today's portrait of Rembrandt shows what he looked like at such a moment.
