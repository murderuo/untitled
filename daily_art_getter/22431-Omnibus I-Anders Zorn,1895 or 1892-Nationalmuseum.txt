It's our last Sunday with our January monthly feature with Nationalmuseum in Stockholm—for the past three Sundays we have been presenting the masterpieces from their magnificent collection. We hope you will like it! :)
Anders Zorn’s Omnibus I was painted during a stay in Paris in the 1890s. Zorn travelled regularly by omnibus from his home in Montmartre, merely to study the passengers. As the bus rolled through the city, the light inside constantly changed. Electric street lights had recently been installed in Paris and the mixture of artificial and natural light created new and unexpected effects, which Zorn tried to capture on canvas. Contemporary critics described Omnibus I as ultra-modern.
