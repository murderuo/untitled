Happy Labor Day everyone!Edvard Munch is Norway’s most important artist, often portrayed as an angst-ridden, brooding Scandinavian who painted scenes of isolation and trauma, which explored themes of love, fear, anxiety, melancholia and death. You probably know his works where he showed rich townspeople and bourgeois'. But he also painted representatives of other social classes. Munch strongly believed that the working class will be the dominant force in the society of the future. The motif of workers exists in several versions, as paintings, drawings and graphic works – including lithography and woodcut. Munch also made a sculpture of the motif. This painting is special because it also shows a very different image of workers than we know from his other works. On them, he painted flowing mass of exhausted men with zombie faces. Here, the child, running to his father makes the whole scene lighter. The girl is like a light in the dark and though life of a worker. See you tomorrow!
