I love art because of a couple of reasons. One of them is that absolutely anything can be painted on the canvas—like today's cauliflower and cabbage. There is nothing spectacular about them—and there is never supposed to be. This is simply a still life with vegetables and fish. Fanny Churberg was a Finnish landscape painter. She started her artistic training in Helsinki in 1865 with private lessons. Her studies continued in Düsseldorf, Germany, but she always returned to Finland to paint during the summer. She was also one of the first Finnish painters to study in Paris, France. She expressed her enthusiasm for the countryside, relying above all on colour and a fast brush technique to do so. While landscape painting was closest to her heart, she also developed an interest in still life painting while studying in Paris. In many ways, Fanny Churberg was a pioneer in the history of Finnish art. She was an independent, ambitious and courageous artist. She painted actively for ten years but then moved on to promote handicrafts.
