Vincent van Gogh was not only a painter but also a great draftsman. Today we present our last piece from this month's special feature of Kröller-Möller Museum collection. It's a must see art museum and sculpture park situated in a middle of the National Park in Otterlo in the Netherlands. It's also the second-largest collection of paintings by Vincent van Gogh. Next Sunday we start a new special feature of the museum which is the world's first university museum..... Any guesses? :) Enjoy!In the summer of 1885, Van Gogh is on the land. There he draws a series of peasant women at work. These are monumental peasant women. Their hands, feet and heads have the ‘inaccuracies’ that Van Gogh wanted to make, as Michelangelo had done, ‘lies if you will — but truer than the literal truth’. This work in the cottages and on the land is still just an exercise.  ‘I really am exercising my hand and, when I say I care relatively little for technique, it’s not because I’m saving myself trouble. […] One must work on technique in so far as one must say what one feels better, more accurately, more profoundly.’
