The Mares of Diomedes, also called the Mares of Thrace, were man-eating horses in Greek mythology. Magnificent, wild, and uncontrollable, they belonged to Diomedes, king of Thrace, son of Ares and Cyrene, who lived on the shores of the Black Sea. 
It was one of Hercules labors to get the man-eating mares of Diomedes and bring them back to Eurystheus in Mycenae, which of course he did. He also killed Diomedes in battle and fed his body to the horses, which tamed them.
Moreau's painting shows the shadowy figure of Hercules observing from between two columns in the background, four wild horses rip apart the slender body of Diomedes. The brown mare fastens her teeth on his arm, while another sinks her jaw into his leg. Bodies of the horses' previous victims lie piled to the right, above a pool of blood-stained water.
