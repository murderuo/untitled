This is our last painting from this month special feature with Museo Sorolla. Don't forget to look back to past three Sundays to see other Sorolla's paintings. :)Today's painting is one of the most important masterpieces shown on the exhibition "Sorolla in Paris" at Museo Sorolla in Madrid. An exhibition that traces the history of the international recognition of Sorolla, from his first trip to Paris, with only twenty-three years, until his victory in the large group exhibitions and his definitive consecration in his individual exhibition at the Gallery Georges Petit in Paris in 1906.Sorolla completed "Sewing the sail" during a summer stay in Cabanil. This composition, which seems to be inspired by a popular stamp, shows women in a landscaped courtyard that sew a white sail, which inflates the dimensions of light. Awarded in Munich and Vienna, the artist sent this work to the Exhibition of Fine Arts in Madrid in 1889.Help us and donate so we will be able to release the new version of DailyArt: http://support.getdailyart.com
