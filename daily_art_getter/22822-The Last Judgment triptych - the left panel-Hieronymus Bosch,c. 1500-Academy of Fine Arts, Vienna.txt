Hieronymus Bosch is among the most fascinating artists working at the end of the medieval world and start of the Renaissance, and his works still have their puzzles for scholars today. The Last Judgment by Bosch, a large three-winged altarpiece, is one of the world’s outstanding masterpieces in art from around 1500.
The three inner wings of the altar depict a series of biblical events that can be read from left to right.  Starting with the left panel, Paradise, and the scene at the top, God the Father (set in a nimbus) is supervising the expulsion of Lucifer and his dark rebel angels from Heaven. The rebel angels transform into insect-like hybrid creatures, and fall into the Garden of Eden. The garden scenes show, from the base of the painting, Eve created from Adam’s rib, the Fall with Adam and Eve eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and the Archangel Gabriel driving them out of Paradise.
Going from the left to the right, Bosch’s painting gets darker and darker…
We present today's masterpiece thanks to Gallery of the Academy of fine Arts Vienna. Next Friday we will feature the central panel of this magnificent Bosch's artwork.
P.S. Here you will find six funny creatures from Hieronymus Bosch paintings that resemble Pokémons! <3
