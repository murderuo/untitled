Mysterious, intriguing, unsettling—each of these words can be used to describe the delicate sculptures created by contemporary American artist Christina Bothwell. Ever since she was a child, Bothwell has had a fascination with birth, death, and renewal. Through her art, she explores what lies within our physical bodies—the soul, the unconscious, our spiritual selves. 
The daughter of an artist, Bothwell studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.  But it wasn't until years later, when she taught herself ceramics and glassmaking, that she found her niche. Since then, she has integrated kiln-cast glass and fired clay (ceramic) in her sculptures which are inspired by nature and often feature children, animals, and even human-animal hybrids. 
The translucent property of glass conveys a lightness of matter making it the ideal medium for expressing the ethereal or otherworldly. While You Are Sleeping imaginatively portrays the weightless soul arising from a sleeping, earthbound figure. The juxtaposition of clay and glass mirrors the physical and the spiritual, what is seen and unseen.
