Mudam Luxembourg – Musée d’Art Moderne Grand-Duc Jean presents new works by Suki Seokyeong Kang (b. 1977, Seoul), the winner of the 2018 Baloise Art Prize. These two sculptures form part of a presentation conceived by the artist for the museum’s Sculpture Garden.
The art of Suki Seokyeong Kang encompasses painting, sculpture, installation, video and choreography. An interest in the human body, its gesture and movement informs the composition of Kang’s sculpture and the evolution of her installations over time. Whilst each work is independent, their placement within a given space is meticulously considered in order to produce an overall harmony that is activated and set in motion by the occasional activation with people. Employing a formal, graphic vocabulary of lines, surface planes, colours and textures, Kang connects diverse traditions, from arts and crafts, to music and choreography. Techniques such as Hwamunseok rush mat weaving or Jeongganbo – a system of musical notation organised in the form of a grid – refer to ancient traditions within Korean culture.
Grandmother Tower – tow #18-01 constitutes an abstract portrait of the artist’s grandmother, describing her curved stature and hesitant gait. It draws upon the artist’s personal history to reflect upon profound changes within South Korean society.
