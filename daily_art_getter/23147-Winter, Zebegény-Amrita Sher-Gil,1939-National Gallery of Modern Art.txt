Amrita Sher-Gil was an eminent Hungarian-Indian painter. She has been called "one of the greatest avant-garde women artists of the early 20th century" and a "pioneer" in modern Indian art.
The painting was purchased by László and Rózsi Urbach directly from Sher-Gil in 1939. László was a Hungarian motorcycle and motorboating champion, photographer, and filmmaker. The couple had several friends who were writers and artists, one of whom was Sher-Gil. They spent a lot of time with the artist, her uncle Baktay, and her step-uncle Ernő Gottesmann. László and Rózsi Urbach purchased the painting as a memento of their excursions and friendship with Sher-Gil, and according to Rózsi, the artist considered the work her "farewell to Europe" (based on correspondence with the current owner in April 2019). The year Winter, Zebegény was painted, Sher-Gil moved to India never to return to Hungary, her place of birth and a country of much artistic inspiration. She died in India two years later.
For me this is a perfect winter landscape. Hope you're getting prepared for Christmas.  :D  See you tomorrow!
